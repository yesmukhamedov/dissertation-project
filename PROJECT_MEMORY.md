# PROJECT MEMORY — index (on drive E:)

Persistent project facts for the dissertation, stored **on the external drive** so they
travel across the candidate's work PC / home laptop / university machine. This replaces
the machine-local `~/.claude/.../memory/` store (which does NOT travel). Read this index
at session start; write new durable facts into `PROJECT_MEMORY/` and add a line here.

Format: one file per fact in `PROJECT_MEMORY/`, with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
`metadata.type`). Link facts with `[[name]]`.

## Experiments / Config-D
- [Config-D pretraining axis](PROJECT_MEMORY/config-d-pretraining.md) — v6.0.0 drops RETFound for ophthalmology SSL; shipped demo Config-D = retired ImageNet artifact (divergence)
- [Continual-SSL init decision](PROJECT_MEMORY/continual-ssl-init-decision.md) — 2026-07-10: integrated arm B/D = ImageNet→continual-SSL ep50 for both backbones; from-scratch SSL failed; ResNet continual +0.25 over ImageNet but **EffNet continual ≈ ImageNet (no benefit — thesis caveat)**; probe noise fixed (deterministic)
- [Linear-probe noise fix](PROJECT_MEMORY/linear-probe-noise-fix.md) — the SSL gate was ~±0.1 κ noisy (EffNet); fixed `src/ssl/probe.py` to deterministic; earlier gate κ (SSL sweep, SIP-ResNet 0.658) are noisy estimates; SIP-ResNet needs re-gate
- [Exp-1 run mechanics + 512² cache](PROJECT_MEMORY/exp1-run-mechanics-512-cache.md) — running Exp-1 needs a 512² Stage 0-4 cache (SSL 256² not reusable) + a single merged config (run_experiment.py ≠ SSL multi-config chain); PYTHONIOENCODING/CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES/detached-orchestrator gotchas
- [Exp-4 launch on WSL box](PROJECT_MEMORY/exp4-wsl-launch.md) — Grad-CAM/H-5 trains 2× EffNet-B4 on EyePACS fold-0 then IoU/ALO on IDRiD; needs BOTH eyepacs+idrid WSL paths fixed (`_run_exp4_wsl.yaml`); detached launch; multi-day; launched 2026-07-17
- [Exp-1 Config C on WSL box](PROJECT_MEMORY/exp1-config-c-wsl-launch.md) — Config C (baseline + EffNet-B3, ImageNet) launched 2026-07-10 on the RTX 3060/WSL box; baseline arm needs NO 512² cache and NO SSL ckpt; merged `_run_exp1C_wsl.yaml`, detached Start-Process, `--resume`-safe; VRAM near-full (~220 MiB headroom)
- [Config-D Kaggle source](PROJECT_MEMORY/config-d-kaggle-source.md) — trains on `dreamer07/eyepacs`; adapter `is_file()` fix; Run#1 EyePACS failed (12h), Run#2 APTOS ok (interim ckpt f1=0.82)
- [Colab Config-D runner](PROJECT_MEMORY/colab-config-d-runner.md) — `experiments/colab/` two-mode; Kaggle=APTOS test, Colab=real EyePACS; persistence on Kaggle Datasets
- [V5 cache / throughput](PROJECT_MEMORY/v5-cache-throughput.md) — GPU-starved by per-image CPU preprocessing; fix = precompute+cache Stages 0–4 (IMPLEMENTED feat/v5-cache-colab)
- [Config-D cache handoff](PROJECT_MEMORY/config-d-cache-handoff.md) — 2026-06-03 handoff; experiments/ mirrored to dr-classifier repo; next = the Colab run
- [SSL WSL launch durability](PROJECT_MEMORY/ssl-wsl-launch-durability.md) — native-Win+WSL RTX 3060 box (drive=D:/mnt/d): harness reaps background tasks AND kills the WSL subtree → launch long GPU jobs DETACHED via `Start-Process`, not run_in_background; eff-B3 fp32 ≈1.9h/epoch (ep300≈24d); `_wsl_local.yaml` needed /mnt/d + sampleSubmission.csv fixes; graded testLabels15.csv MISSING here (blocks the probe gate)
- [Stage-2 FOV crop fix](PROJECT_MEMORY/stage2-fov-crop-fix.md) — 2026-07-19: the crop box (not the mask) cut ~21% of the retina on frames with no dark surround (all APTOS, often the optic disc); box now derives from the FOV mask. Config-D checkpoint stays valid (EyePACS 35/40→37/40); **512² cache + Exp-3 need regeneration**
- [Preprocessing: OD/fovea + polar CLAHE](PROJECT_MEMORY/preprocessing-od-fovea-polar.md) — classical detector unreliable (fovea fails); polar CLAHE now Stage-5 default pivoting on FOV centroid → checkpoints must be retrained; **2026-06-18 decided to replace with learned heatmap detector**
- [OD/fovea heatmap detector plan](PROJECT_MEMORY/od-fovea-heatmap-detector-plan.md) — learned U-Net+DSNT heatmap detector (FundusPosNet ref); build spec in `experiments/docs/od_fovea_heatmap_detector_brief.md`; INVARIANTS OD-3 applied (v6.1.0). **Phases 1–4 DONE (2026-06-23): trained+validated, pipeline-integrated, demo discs/heatmap/drag-correct + correction store, and Phase-4 offline feedback loop (`scripts/export_corrections.py` + `finetune_corrections.py`: dedup + test-leakage-filtered export → fine-tune from frozen base weights → versioned `od_fovea_unet_vN.pt` gated on IDRiD-test acceptance). Operator run pending real corrections.** (Root 4-phase task brief `TASK_OD_FOVEA_DETECTOR.md` removed 2026-06-23 once all phases landed.)

## Datasets
- [EyePACS local dataset](PROJECT_MEMORY/eyepacs-local-dataset.md) — `E:\datasets\EyePACS` is the FULL 88,702-img set (train 35,126 + test 53,576), not partial; test labels added 2026-06-26 (`testLabels15.csv`, verified 1:1); 66.6 GB redundant split-zips still on disk

## Cross-cutting
- [Strip version markers](PROJECT_MEMORY/strip-version-markers.md) — V5 IS a version marker; remove V5/V4/V3 outside thesis/; defense/experiments/demo/server done, council export now auto-scrubbed in md2gost.py (2026-06-12), root TODO
- [Demo stack](PROJECT_MEMORY/demo-stack.md) — local launch = `demo/start-demo.ps1`/`.bat` (one-shot, default); manual WSL/npm commands + Cloudflare tunnels for the real model; human copy `demo/RUNBOOK.md`
