**How to actually run Experiment 1 on the native-Windows RTX 5070 Ti box** (learned
2026-07-10 launching Config D). Non-obvious mechanics that cost investigation:

**1. `run_experiment.py` loads ONE config file** (`load_config`, not the `load_configs`
multi-`--config` chain the SSL scripts use). So you must pre-merge into a single file:
`load_configs("configs/default.yaml","configs/_win_local.yaml","<overlay>.yaml")` +
`yaml.safe_dump`. The merged run configs are `configs/_run_exp1D*.yaml` — **machine-specific
(contain C:/ D: paths), gitignored, uncommitted**. Regenerate per machine.

**2. Full-pipeline configs (B/D) need a 512² Stage 0-4 cache.** Live preprocessing runs the
8-stage pipeline incl. the U-Net OD/fovea detector per image (~0.39 img/s) → infeasible
(months for 35k×5 folds). The **SSL 256² cache is NOT reusable** (wrong resolution). Build the
512² cache once: `scripts/precompute_cache.py --images-root D:/datasets/EyePACS/train
--labels-csv .../trainLabels.csv --output-dir C:/ssl_data/cache_512 --preset efficientnet
--num-workers 14` (resumable). Then set `paths.cache_dir: C:/ssl_data/cache_512` in the merged
config → exp1 uses `CachedEyePACSDataset` (runs only Stages 5–7 live). Norm stats already exist
at `experiments/data/processed/eyepacs_norm_stats.json` (dataset-specific, thesis-faithful).

**3. Native-Windows ops gotchas:**
- **`PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` is mandatory** for scripts that print Unicode — `precompute_cache.py`
  crashes at the very end printing a box-drawing char under the cp1252 console (work is already
  done, but exit code is non-zero → breaks orchestrators). `run_ssl_pretrain.py` self-reconfigures;
  `precompute_cache.py` does not.
- **Run the precompute detector on CPU** via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''` so 14 spawn workers don't
  each grab GPU memory (contention/OOM). Training stages then get the GPU (unset the var).
- **Detached `Start-Process` (hidden, `-RedirectStandardOutput`) is the durable launch** — harness
  background jobs get killed. Long chains run as a detached PS orchestrator that writes a DONE/ABORT
  marker (pattern: `C:/ssl_out/orchestrate_*.ps1` → `*_DONE.txt`). PARSE-check with
  `[PSParser]::Tokenize` before launching (PS 5.1 chokes on nested-if + `*>>` + here-strings).
- Env python: `C:/mamba/envs/dr-classifier/python.exe` (torch 2.11+cu128, Blackwell sm_120).

**4. `_eval_utils._train_fresh` bug does NOT block Exp-1** — Config A–D go through
`Trainer.train_fold`, not the broken fresh-train path (that is an exp2/blending concern).

**5. STANDING RULE — at experiment end, consolidate all results onto the traveling drive D:.**
On this machine D: is the **external drive the project rides on**; C: is fast internal scratch
that does NOT travel. Exp-1 results (`outputs/exp1/`: metrics + Config D checkpoints) already
live on D: (project root is on D:), but the SSL/continual/gate artifacts, run logs, and the 512
cache sit on **C:** and would be lost when the machine is reset. Copy them to D: at the end:
`C:/ssl_out/save_results_to_D.ps1` (idempotent — robocopies `C:/ssl_out` → `outputs/ssl_run_artifacts/`
and tars the 512 cache → `outputs/cache_512.tar` as ONE sequential write, safe on external D:).
It fires automatically via `C:/ssl_out/watch_and_save_D.ps1` when `EXPD_DONE.txt` appears (not
reboot-proof — re-run manually if the machine restarts). Marker: `outputs/RESULTS_SAVED.txt`.
Caveat: Config D writes checkpoints per-epoch straight to D: (external) — flaky-USB risk like the
SSL `train_state`; `--resume` mitigates.
