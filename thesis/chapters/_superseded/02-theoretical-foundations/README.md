# Chapter 2: Theoretical Foundations

**Status:** Not started
**Chapter function:** Mathematical and theoretical grounding for methods in Chapters 3–4
**Governance bindings:** OD-1 through OD-6, DGL-5, DGL-6, SIR-3, SIR-6, **SB-1.12, SIR-9 (v5.3 — minor; main paradigmatic discussion lives in Ch 1.4)**

**Paradigmatic framing note (v5.3).** Chapter 2 provides mathematical and theoretical grounding; the paradigmatic discussion itself is sited in Chapter 1.4. Where Chapter 2 discusses CNN feature hierarchies, transfer learning theory, or preprocessing methods (histogram equalisation, flat-field correction, CLAHE), it must be consistent with the paradigm P2 reading: preprocessing is treated as a component of the model whose mathematical properties co-determine the feature space presented to the convolutional layers. Forbidden phrasings from INVARIANTS v5.3 CFC-2.9 apply throughout.
