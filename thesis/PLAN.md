# MASTER WRITING PLAN — Dissertation, Section by Section

**Document type:** Execution plan (the live to-do board for drafting the entire dissertation)
**Candidate:** Yesmukhamedov N.S.
**Compiled:** 2026-06-09
**Grounded in:**
- `thesis/ASSET_INVENTORY.md` (resource IDs, real-vs-demo provenance, §2 reconciliation table)
- `thesis/governance/` v6.0.0 (INVARIANTS, HYPOTHESIS, ARGUMENT_MAP, RESEARCH_ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTIONS)
- `thesis/prompts/` v6.0.0 pipeline (`section-brief-template.md`, `writing-session-system-prompt.md`, `verification-protocol.md`, `continuity-note-template.md`)
- `thesis/outline/MASTER_OUTLINE.md` (§-level content spec) reconciled to the **v6.0.0 Section Map Key** in `thesis/literature/LITERATURE_INDEX.md` (authoritative numbering)
- `thesis/literature/LITERATURE_INDEX.md` Coverage Matrix (literature-card IDs per section)

> **Scope of this document:** This is the plan only. **No chapter draft is written here.** Drafting begins only after the candidate reviews and approves this plan.

## 0. How to read this plan

1. **Progress Tracker (§1)** is the master checklist — every section with a live status box. Update it as you go.
2. **Phasing (§2)** orders the work by *data-readiness*: what is writable now vs. what is gated on experiment execution, with the exact unblocking resource IDs.
3. **Resource Honesty Policy (§3)** is the binding rule that decides whether a section may be drafted at all.
4. **Section Task Tables (§4–§9)** give, for every `§x.x.x`: target word count, governance bindings, literature-card IDs, the figure/table Resource IDs it must reference, and the ✅/⛔ verdict.
5. **Per-Section Execution Loop (§10)** is the exact a–f procedure to run for each *writable* section.
6. **Final Assembly (§11, Phase 3)** is the LAST step — concatenate, resolve placeholders, convert to `.docx`. It depends on Phase 2 completion.

**Literature-card IDs** are given as `#NN`, matching the Source Index numbers in `LITERATURE_INDEX.md` (e.g. `#12` = `gulshan-2016.md`; `#19–#24` = self-publications in `literature/self/`). **Resource IDs** (`FIG-x.x`, `TAB-x.x`, `RES-*`, `DIA-*`, `APP-*`) match `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §2`.

**Status legend (per-section):**
- ⬜ not started · 🟦 brief done · 🟩 draft done · ✅ verified (APPROVED by verification-protocol)

**Writability flag (per-section):**
- ✅ **writable-now** — every result-dependent resource it needs is `✅ AVAILABLE` or literature-derived; safe to draft.
- ⛔ **blocked-by-[ID]** — requires a resource that is `❌ MISSING (real result)`; stays blocked until the experiment is run.
- ⚠️ **writable-now (deferred asset)** — prose is writable now; a *conceptual/UML diagram* it references is not yet drawn (not experiment-gated). The diagram is queued as an asset task and inserted as a `TO BE CREATED` placeholder — see §3.2.

### Phase 2 — UNBLOCKED (all experiments run)

> **Gate status changed.** Every experiment has been executed and all seven hypotheses are confirmed.
> The gating resources G-1…G-19 below are historical; the live status of each asset is
> `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §2` and the live numbers are `results/` (`tables/`, `findings/`, `hypotheses/`),
> which is the **single source of truth**. Two residual constraints, not full blocks:
> **G-3** — the clinical (KZ) Grad-CAM overlays were not produced, so §4.6 is writable in its
> quantitative part only; **NEW-1** — the run's raw artifacts are not yet in `experiments/outputs/`,
> so results are writable but not yet traceable to a primary output file (must close before defense).
>
> **Structural change:** H-3 (domain distance) is reinstated as a new **§4.4**; Exp 3–7 shift to
> §4.5–§4.9. See `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §1.3`.

## 2. PHASING BY DATA-READINESS

### Phase 1 — writable now (no real-result dependency)

Narrative order is fixed by the task:

> **Ch 1 (Problem Domain) → Ch 2 (Theoretical Foundations) → Ch 3 (Methodology, fully unblocked) → Ch 6 (System Architecture, design-only) → §4.1 (Datasets & Configuration).**

Rationale (from `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §1.3`): these chapters draw only on real artifacts already on disk — preprocessing stage renders (FIG-3.1…FIG-3.9), the OD/fovea validation (RES-VAL, FIG-3.10), norm-stats (RES-NORM), the PCA basis (RES-PCA), conceptual/architecture diagrams, dataset sample montages, the publication certificates (APP-D), and the literature corpus. No experimental *result* is required. App A (source code) and App D (certificates) are also writable now and are produced alongside Phase 1.

### Phase 2 — blocked, gated on experiment execution

Order (as instructed): **§4.2 → §4.3–§4.8 → Ch 5 → Ch 0 → Ch 7 → Appendices B/C/E/F.** For each, the exact missing Resource IDs (from `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §2`) that unblock it:

| Gate | Section(s) | Unblocking experiment | Missing Resource IDs that must become real |
|------|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| G-1 | §4.2.2, §4.2.3 (+ §4.C dependency) | **Exp 1** full A–D × 5-fold @100% incl. ophthalmology-SSL B/D arm + per-sample prediction dumps | TAB-4.2, FIG-4.4, FIG-4.5(full), FIG-4.6, FIG-4.7, FIG-4.8, TAB-4.3; RES-EXP1 upgraded ⏳→✅ |
| G-2 | §4.3.1–§4.3.3 | **Exp 2** (ablation + CLAHE sweep + σ sweep + image-quality) | TAB-4.4, FIG-4.9, FIG-4.10, TAB-4.5 |
| G-3 | §4.4.1, §4.4.2 | **Exp 3** (APTOS 2019 zero-shot transfer, G ratio) | TAB-4.6, FIG-4.11 |
| G-4 | §4.5.1–§4.5.3 | **Exp 4** (Grad-CAM ALO/IoU on IDRiD + Clinical) | FIG-4.12, TAB-4.7, FIG-4.13, FIG-4.14 |
| G-5 | §4.6 | **Exp 5** (clinical degradation, IDRiD + Messidor-2) | TAB-4.8, FIG-4.15 |
| G-6 | §4.7 | **Exp 6** (device domain shift, DDR/ODIR-5K/RFMiD) | TAB-4.9, App F set |
| G-7 | §4.8 | **Exp 7** (small-data IDRiD → Clinical) | TAB-4.10, FIG-4.16 |
| G-8 | §4.C | All of Exp 1–7 | (all of the above) |
| G-9 | §5.1 | Exp 4 | FIG-5.1, TAB-4.7, FIG-4.12 |
| G-10 | §5.2.1 | Exp 1–7 statistical suite | TAB-5.1 |
| G-11 | §5.2.2 | All Exp + claim-strength derivation | TAB-5.2, FIG-5.3 |
| G-12 | §5.3.1 | Own results + Exp 1/3/5 | TAB-5.3, TAB-5.4 |
| G-13 | §5.3.2 | Exp 1/6 | FIG-5.2, FIG-5.4 |
| G-14 | §5.4, §5.C | Final H-1…H-7 verdicts | (none new; depends on §4.C + §5.2.2) |
| G-15 | §0.8, §7 | Final claim strengths | depends on §5.2.2 (TAB-5.2) |
| G-16 | App B | Exp 1–7 | FIG-4.6, FIG-4.5(full), TAB-4.3 + per-Exp confusion/curves |
| G-17 | App C | UML drawing (asset, not experiment) | DIA-6.3 |
| G-18 | App E | Exp 4 | FIG-5.1, FIG-4.12 |
| G-19 | App F | Exp 6 | TAB-4.9 + per-camera matrices |

> **Note on Exp 1 partial data:** `RES-EXP1` is `⏳ PENDING` — real per-epoch metrics exist for Config A f0, A/B/C f0–2 @40%, and a clean Config D f0 (EyePACS). These are **not** sufficient for §4.2: the headline 2×2 factorial table (TAB-4.2) and the EH-3 dominance verdict require the full 100% A–D × 5-fold run, and the v6.0.0 ophthalmology-SSL initialization for the integrated arm (B/D) has not been trained at all. Confusion matrices / ROC / calibration (FIG-4.6/4.7, TAB-4.3) are *not derivable* from current outputs because per-sample predictions were not saved (`ASSET_INVENTORY.md §3 note 3`). §4.2 therefore stays blocked.

### Phase 3 — final assembly (LAST step, depends on Phase 2 completion)

See §11.

## 3. RESOURCE HONESTY POLICY (binding)

### 3.1 Hard honesty rule

**A section may NEVER be drafted if any *result-dependent* resource it requires is `❌ MISSING (real result)` in `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`.** Such sections stay ⛔ blocked and are skipped until the experiment is run. Specifically:

- **No fabricated metrics.** No number may be written into a results table/figure unless it comes from a real, machine-produced artifact verified in `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §3`.
- **No demo-dashboard previews as if real.** The files in `demo/web/public/results/` and the preview JSONs (`exp3_aptos_transfer.json` G=0.890, `exp5_degradation.json`, `exp7_small_data.json`, `exp2_ff_sweep.json`) carry placeholder numbers authored for the dashboard. They are **demo assets**, not results, and must not be cited as evidence (per **CFC-2.x / SIR-1**, and the §0 Provenance Policy of the inventory).
- **CFC-2.8 reminder for §4.2 / H-1:** the integrated arm uses ophthalmology-SSL pretraining and the baseline uses ImageNet; once results exist, any difference is attributed to the **integrated configuration**, never to "preprocessing alone."

### 3.2 Conceptual / UML diagrams are *deferred assets*, not blockers

A resource that is `❌ MISSING` but is a **conceptual or architecture/UML diagram with no experimental dependency** (FIG-2.1, FIG-2.3, FIG-2.4, FIG-2.5, DIA-6.3 / App C) does **not** hard-block its section — the prose carries no fabricated data. For these:

- The section is **⚠️ writable-now (deferred asset)**.
- Insert the figure as a placeholder marked **TO BE CREATED**, e.g. `[FIG-2.1: Histogram equalization → CLAHE intensity redistribution — ASSET TO BE CREATED]`.
- Log the diagram in the asset-creation queue (it is resolved during Phase 3 §11.2, or earlier if drawn).
- This distinction is consistent with `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §1.3`, which lists Ch 2 and Ch 6 as writable-now despite these missing diagrams ("some diagrams reusable, others to draw"; Ch 6 "only blocker: UML").

This is the **only** relaxation of the hard rule. It applies to non-result diagrams exclusively. Any figure/table tied to an unrun experiment remains a hard block.

## 10. AUTONOMOUS PER-SECTION EXECUTION LOOP

For **each writable section, in the Phase-1 narrative order** (then Phase-2 order as gates open), run steps **a → f**. Do not skip a step; do not batch across sections.

**Pre-step (gate check):** Confirm against `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §2` that no result-dependent resource the section requires is `❌ MISSING`. If one is, **STOP** — leave the section ⛔ and move to the next writable section (§3.1). Deferred conceptual/UML diagrams (§3.2) do not stop the loop.

**a. Section Brief.** Generate the brief from `prompts/section-brief-template.md` v6.0.0. Fill *all* fields, in particular: **Argumentative Spine** (thesis / reasoning chain / hand-off), **Acceptance Criteria**, **Paradigm positioning** (P1/P2, permitted vs forbidden Gulshan phrasings per CFC-2.9/SIR-9), plus the governance bindings, lit-card source mapping, and required Resource IDs from this plan's section row.
→ Save to `thesis/chapters/<NN-chapter>/briefs/<§x.x.x>-brief.md`. Set tracker to **🟦**.

**b. Self-review the brief.** Check the brief against governance (INVARIANTS v6.0.0 + the bindings listed for the section). Flag any **coverage gap** (a required content element with no mapped literature card → mark for `[UNSOURCED CLAIM]` handling or candidate-original analysis; note lit-THIN/GAP sections from the Coverage Matrix). Resolve or explicitly accept each gap before drafting.

**c. Draft.** Generate the section using `prompts/writing-session-system-prompt.md` v6.0.0 (load: system prompt → INVARIANTS.md → the Brief → relevant literature cards → preceding Continuity Note). Output PART 1 (prose + tables in Markdown), PART 2 (Continuity Note), PART 3 (compliance checklist).
- **Figures:** reference by Resource ID with a caption and the **real file path from `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`**. **Do NOT embed images.** Insert a placeholder the later `.docx` step can resolve, e.g.
  `[FIG-3.6: Stage 4 — Adaptive flat-field correction — defense/presentation/assets/preprocessing/15_flatfield/stage4_flatfield.png]`
  For a deferred conceptual/UML diagram, use `… — ASSET TO BE CREATED` (§3.2).
- **Tables** that are `✅ AVAILABLE` as governance text (TAB-2.1, TAB-3.1/3.2/3.3, TAB-4.1) are rendered inline as Markdown.

**d. Verify.** Run `prompts/verification-protocol.md` v6.0.0 against the draft + brief + INVARIANTS (sections A–H: claim compliance, forbidden-content scan CFC-2.1…2.9, terminology, source handling SIR-1…9, structural integrity, scope/paradigm, evidence thresholds). Verdict: **APPROVED** or **REVISION NEEDED**. If revision needed → run `prompts/revision-session-template.md`, re-verify. Only APPROVED advances.

**e. Continuity note.** Confirm PART 2 is complete and accurate (key concepts, terms introduced, argument thread, final topic, setup for next section, unresolved threads).
→ Save to `thesis/chapters/<NN-chapter>/continuity/<§x.x.x>-continuity.md`.

**f. Save draft.** Save the approved PART 1 to `thesis/chapters/<NN-chapter>/drafts/<§x.x.x>-draft.md` (and the verification record to `reviews/`, session transcript to `sessions/`). Set tracker to **🟩** on save, **✅** once verification is APPROVED.

> Carry the saved Continuity Note into step **c** of the *next* section so its opening paragraph connects to the prior argument thread.

---

## 11. PHASE 3 — FINAL ASSEMBLY (LAST step; depends on Phase 2 completion)

Run only after **every** section in §1 is ✅ verified (all Phase-1 *and* Phase-2 gates cleared). Do not start earlier.

**§11.1 Concatenate.** Assemble all approved `drafts/*.md` in exact `MASTER_OUTLINE.md` order: Front Matter → Introduction (Ch 0) → Ch 1 → Ch 2 → Ch 3 → Ch 4 (§4.1 → §4.2 → … → §4.8 → §4.C) → Ch 5 → Ch 6 → Ch 7 (Conclusion) → References → Appendices A–F.

**§11.2 Resolve placeholders.** Replace every `[FIG-x.x: …]` / `[TAB-x.x: …]` placeholder with its real asset, using the file path from `ASSET_INVENTORY.md §2`. Any remaining `ASSET TO BE CREATED` (FIG-2.1, FIG-2.3, FIG-2.4, FIG-2.5, DIA-6.3/App C) must be drawn and dropped in here before conversion. Verify no placeholder, no `[UNSOURCED CLAIM]`, and no `[TERM NOT IN GLOSSARY]` flag survives.

**§11.3 Convert to `.docx`.** Convert the single assembled Markdown document to one `.docx` (e.g. via Pandoc with a reference docx for dissertation styling), embedding the resolved figures and rendering tables. Output: one defense-ready `.docx`. (Kazakh translation is a separate downstream pipeline — Stages E/F — and is out of scope for this plan.)

## 12. SUMMARY

- **Writable now (Phase 1): 51 sections** — Ch 1 (11) + Ch 2 (15) + Ch 3 (13) + Ch 6 (9) + §4.1 (3) — **plus Appendix A and Appendix D** (already `✅ AVAILABLE`). Four of these (§2.1.1, §2.4.1, §2.5.1, §2.6) and §6.1.2/App C carry **deferred conceptual/UML diagrams**, which do not block the prose (§3.2).
- **Blocked (Phase 2): 42 sections** — Ch 4 §4.2–§4.8 + §4.C (15) + Ch 5 (7) + Ch 0 (15, of which 13 are content-writable-now and 2 hard-blocked) + Ch 7 (1) + Appendices B/C/E/F (4) — each gated on the missing Resource IDs catalogued in §2 and §9.
- **Hard honesty rule is in force:** no section is drafted while a result-dependent resource it needs is `❌ MISSING`; no demo-dashboard preview numbers are ever used as real results (CFC-2.x / SIR-1).
- **Phase 3 is last** and runs only after all sections verify.

**First section to execute: §1.1.1 — Pathophysiology and Clinical Grading Systems.** ✅ Confirmed.

> Awaiting candidate review of this plan before any section is drafted.
