## Integrated Preprocessing–CNN Framework for Multi-Stage Diabetic Retinopathy Classification

**Candidate:** Yesmukhamedov N.S.
**Status:** Binding Methodological Blueprint
**Function:** Experimental, statistical, and architectural formalization of the dissertation research
**Version:** 7.0.0 | **Date:** 2026-08-04 | **Binding Reference:** INVARIANTS.md v7.0.0

**v7.0.0 Amendment:** §5.5 (Experiment 5) is rewritten in step with the H-7 reformulation (INVARIANTS v7.0.0) — purpose, metric definitions and success criterion move from the retired Δ_drop degradation form to absolute external performance (Δ wF1 ≥ MCID 0.050, CI⁻ > 0, both datasets, no aggregation). The §9.1 H-7 bullet and the PC-10 traceability row are synced. No experimental protocol, dataset role, or other experiment definition changes.

**v6.2.0 Amendment:** Operationalizes the locked fundus-SSL corpus and acceptance protocol for the integrated arm (no design/factorial/hypothesis change). §4.2bis is extended to fix the SSL corpus as the unlabeled EyePACS "test" split (53,576 images, disjoint from the ~35,126 Experiment-1 corpus per INVARIANTS SB-2.4), to record **BYOL** as the primary CNN-compatible protocol (MoCo-v2 / SimSiam / DINO as alternatives) pretrained **from-scratch on the 4-channel tensor**, and to add the **linear-probe acceptance gate** as the precondition for an SSL checkpoint to enter Experiment 1. §9.1 (Leakage Control) gains a pretraining-corpus-disjointness bullet. Adds referenceable entities (SB-2.4, the acceptance gate) without reversing any binding → MINOR bump per INVARIANTS v6.2.0. CFC-2.8 and the composite independent variable are retained.

**v6.1.0 Amendment:** The OD-3 Stage-1 detector is updated from classical CV to a pre-trained, frozen heatmap-regression detector (U-Net + DSNT head, trained on IDRiD localization ground-truth) with genuine per-landmark confidence; fallback rotation σ reconciled to 15.0°. The detector is frozen (not co-trained with the DR classifier), preserving `model = preprocessing + CNN`. MINOR bump per INVARIANTS v6.1.0; no experimental-design, factorial, or hypothesis change.

**v6.0.0 Amendment:** RETFound is removed as the integrated-arm initialization source. The integrated arm of Experiment 1 now initializes the existing CNN backbone (ResNet-50 / EfficientNet-B3) from **ophthalmology-specific self-supervised pretraining** on an unlabeled retinal fundus corpus (CNN-compatible domain-adaptive SSL — DINO / BYOL / SimCLR / MoCo family — selected empirically). Because the SSL initialization is CNN-native, the 2×2 *(preprocessing × architecture)* factorial is restored: the retired configs **B and D are reinstated** and config **B′ is retired**. Section 4.2bis and Section 5.1 are updated; AOQ-1/AOQ-3/AOQ-4 are resolved and AOQ-2 is simplified (INVARIANTS v6.0.0 Section X). The composite *(preprocessing × pretraining)* independent variable and CFC-2.8 are retained.

**v5.2 Amendment:** RETFound's pretraining corpus is described as the multi-modal retinal imaging corpus on which the foundation model was actually pretrained per Zhou et al. 2023 — ≈904K color fundus photographs (CFP) + ≈736K OCT scans (~1.6M total). The integrated arm of Experiment 1 loads the CFP-pretrained RETFound checkpoint specifically (the OCT-pretrained checkpoint is published separately and is not used; the dissertation's inputs remain fundus-only per SB-1.4 in INVARIANTS.md). Section 4.2bis is updated accordingly. *(Superseded by v6.0.0: RETFound is no longer used.)*

**v5.1 Amendment:** The Experiment 1 factorial is amended so that the integrated arm uses RETFound (in-domain retinal pretrain) and the baseline arm retains ImageNet (cross-domain pretrain). Section 4 (Model Architecture Layer) and Section 5.1 (Experiment 1) reflect the amendment. The operational specifications listed under AOQ-1 through AOQ-4 (INVARIANTS v5.1, Section X) are open and must be resolved before experimental execution; cells marked "TBD per AOQ-x" in this document refer to those open questions.

## 2.2 Split Strategy

All experiments use **5-fold cross-validation with patient-level stratified split** to prevent data leakage. For each fold iteration, 4 folds serve as training data and 1 fold as test data. The process is repeated 5 times. All metrics are reported as mean ± standard deviation across folds.

Patient-level leakage control is mandatory: no patient's images may appear in both training and test partitions within any fold.

---

## 2.3 Cross-Database Generalization

Cross-database generalization defined as:

G = F1_external / F1_EyePACS

where F1_EyePACS is the test-set F1-score on the primary training dataset (EyePACS) and F1_external is the F1-score on external datasets (APTOS 2019, IDRiD, Messidor-2, or domain shift datasets) under the same trained model without retraining. Bounded strictly per OD-4.

---

# 3. PREPROCESSING PIPELINE ARCHITECTURE

Defined per OD-3.

**Key Scientific Framing:** The preprocessing pipeline is defined as an integral component of the diagnostic model — Stage 1 of a two-stage system: `model = preprocessing + CNN`. This is the central design decision of this work: preprocessing is not ancillary data preparation but defines the feature space available to the CNN.

## 3.1 Ordered Pipeline (8-Stage System)

The preprocessing pipeline comprises eight ordered stages. All stages are always on except Stage 6 (train only):

- **Stage 0: Canonical Flip** — Left-eye images are horizontally flipped to right-eye canonical orientation (OD right, macula left). Always on.
- **Stage 1: OD-Fovea Rotation Normalization** — A pre-trained, frozen heatmap-regression detector (U-Net encoder + DSNT head, trained on IDRiD localization ground-truth) predicts probability heatmaps for the OD and fovea centers on the FOV-cropped frame; rotates image so OD→fovea axis is horizontal. Per-landmark confidence from heatmap peak sharpness and spread. Fallback: skip rotation on low confidence (and pivot Stage-5 polar CLAHE on the FOV centroid). Augmentation rotation σ is adaptive per-image from heatmap-derived localization uncertainty (fallback σ = 15.0°). Detector is pre-trained and frozen — not co-trained with the DR classifier — preserving `model = preprocessing + CNN`. Always on. (Detection runs on the FOV-cropped frame from Stage 2; stage numbering retained.)
- **Stage 2: FOV Crop + Isotropic Resize** — Foreground detection, crop to FOV region, isotropic scale to 512×512 with centered zero-padding preserving fundus circle geometry. Always on.
- **Stage 3: FOV Mask Generation** — Binary mask (1.0 = real fundus data, 0.0 = zero-padding) appended as 4th input channel. Always on.
- **Stage 4: Flat-Field Correction** — Gaussian blur subtraction (corrected = image − GaussianBlur(image, σ) + 128) with adaptive σ = 0.07 × D (D = FOV diameter in pixels from mask). Applied inside FOV mask only. Always on.
- **Stage 5: CLAHE** — Dual-constraint clip limit on LAB L-channel: CL = min(clip_factor × tile_area / 256, global_threshold × tile_area). Tile grid 8×8. Stochastic at train time (p = 0.8); deterministic at inference. Always on.
- **Stage 6: Augmentation** — Train only. Applied on-the-fly in order: (1) unified affine transform (rotation σ adaptive from Stage 1, zoom [0.9, 1.1], optional shear/stretch); (2) ColorJitter — brightness, contrast, and saturation (each factor ∈ [0.9, 1.1]) and hue (shift ∈ [−0.02, 0.02]), each component applied independently with p = 0.5; (3) Gaussian noise (σ ∈ [2, 6] on the 8-bit RGB scale, p = 0.15); (4) JPEG compression (quality ∈ [70, 100], p = 0.20). Applied before Stage 7 (operates on uint8).
- **Stage 7: Dataset-Specific Normalization** — ToTensor (HWC uint8 → CHW float32 [0,1]) then channel-wise (x − mean) / std using mean and std computed from EyePACS training set after Stages 0–4, using only pixels where FOV mask = 1.0. Output: float32 tensor of shape (4, 512, 512). Always on. Always last.

Pipeline **ACTIVE** (full pipeline): All 8 stages applied. Stage 6 active during training only. Output: 4-channel tensor (3 RGB + 1 FOV mask). Pipeline **ABSENT** (baseline): Stretch-resize to 512×512 + ImageNet normalize (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]). Output: 3-channel tensor. No FOV mask. No preprocessing stages applied.

---

## 3.2 CLAHE Mathematical Formalization

Dual-Constraint Clip Limit:

CL_tile = min(clip_factor × tile_area / 256, global_threshold × tile_area)

where clip_factor and global_threshold are tunable hyperparameters. Applied stochastically at train time (probability = 0.80); applied deterministically at inference time.

Transferability from STARE to EyePACS is NOT assumed (DGL-5). clip limit parameters must be independently validated within the dissertation's experimental framework.

---

## 3.3 Image Quality Metrics

To quantify the effect of preprocessing independently of downstream classification, the following image quality metrics are measured at each pipeline stage (before and after each component):

| Metric | Measures | Expected Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) | Signal quality of vessel structures vs. background | Higher CNR after flat-field correction and CLAHE |
| Vessel Visibility Index (VVI) | Detectability of retinal vasculature | Improved after flat-field correction and CLAHE |
| Image Entropy | Information content of the image | Increased after contrast enhancement |
| Structural Similarity (SSIM) | Preservation of structural information relative to original | High SSIM confirms no destructive artifacts introduced |

These metrics are reported in Experiment 2 (pipeline analysis) and provide evidence for the causal chain link: preprocessing → improved microvascular feature visibility.

## 4.1 ResNet-50 — Backbone (Baseline and integrated Arms) [v6.0.0]

* Baseline arm (config A): initialized from **ImageNet** (IMAGENET1K_V2 weights via torchvision), 3-channel input.
* integrated arm (config B): initialized from **ophthalmology-specific self-supervised pretraining** on an unlabeled fundus corpus, 4-channel input (RGB + FOV mask).
* Adapted via fine-tuning for 5-class DR classification
* Represents the residual-connection architecture family

---

## 4.2 EfficientNet-B3 — Backbone (Baseline and integrated Arms) [v6.0.0]

* Baseline arm (config C): initialized from **ImageNet** (timm weights), 3-channel input.
* integrated arm (config D): initialized from **ophthalmology-specific self-supervised pretraining** on an unlabeled fundus corpus, 4-channel input (RGB + FOV mask).
* Adapted via fine-tuning for 5-class DR classification
* Represents the compound-scaling architecture family (EfficientNet)

---

## 4.2bis Ophthalmology-Specific Self-Supervised Pretraining — integrated Arm Source (v6.0.0)

* **Approach:** The integrated arm initializes the same CNN backbone used in the baseline arm (ResNet-50 or EfficientNet-B3) from **ophthalmology-specific self-supervised pretraining** on an unlabeled retinal fundus corpus, rather than from generic ImageNet weights or from an external foundation model. This changes only the *initialization stage*, preserving the CNN architecture across both arms.
* **Pretraining protocol:** A CNN-compatible domain-adaptive self-supervised learning protocol from the **DINO / BYOL / SimCLR / MoCo** family. **[v6.2.0] BYOL (Grill et al., 2020) is the primary protocol** — negative-free, batch-size-robust, and well-suited to the single-GPU 12 GB budget — with **MoCo-v2 / SimSiam / DINO retained as alternatives** behind a method flag; the final protocol is confirmed empirically by the linear-probe gate below. No diabetic-retinopathy labels are used during pretraining; the objective is representation learning over fundus imagery — vascular topology, optic-disc and macular morphology, retinal texture, illumination variability, and imaging artifacts. The backbone is pretrained **from-scratch (random initialization)**, not from ImageNet.
* **Pretraining corpus (v6.2.0):** The unlabeled **EyePACS original "test" split — 53,576 images** (`EyePACS/test/*.jpeg`). This corpus is **disjoint** from the Experiment-1 evaluation corpus (the ~35,126 labeled "train" split, INVARIANTS SB-2.4) by image identity and patient identity — a no-pretraining-leakage constraint (analogous to ImageNet for the baseline arm). The corpus is pretraining-only and is never folded into Experiment-1 supervised training. Pretraining runs at 256² (downstream fine-tuning at 512²; CNN trunks with adaptive pooling are resolution-agnostic).
* **Input channels:** Because the SSL pretraining is performed in-house, the encoder is pretrained directly on the 4-channel tensor (RGB + FOV mask), eliminating any input-channel mismatch (AOQ-2 simplified); photometric augmentations are applied to the RGB channels only, geometric augmentations to all four (the FOV mask stays binary). The copy-and-mean-init protocol for channel 3 (`experiments/src/models/resnet.py` lines 47–52) remains available as a fallback.
* **Linear-probe acceptance gate (v6.2.0):** No SSL checkpoint enters Experiment 1 until it passes a frozen-backbone linear-probe gate. With all backbone weights frozen, a single linear head is trained and evaluated on a label-bearing slice of the EyePACS-test corpus (the `testLabels15.csv` grades, used here only — never by the pretext task), against random-init and ImageNet-init baselines under the same protocol. A checkpoint **passes** iff, for **both** backbones, it (a) beats random init by a clear quadratic-weighted-κ margin and (b) is competitive with (within a small κ margin of, or better than) ImageNet, without representation collapse. Should the gate fail, the documented fallback is an **ImageNet→continual-SSL** initialization (flagged in the run manifest), which slightly softens the "fundus-only" contrast.
* **Rationale:** Adopting RETFound (ViT-Large) would change both the architecture and the initialization, confounding the preprocessing contribution with an architecture change. A CNN-native SSL initialization isolates the architecture factor, preserving the CNN-centred research design and a defensible causal interpretation of the preprocessing contrast.
* **Role:** Initialization source for the integrated arm of Experiment 1 (configs B and D), paired with the full preprocessing pipeline (4 channels, 512×512).
* **Resolved questions (INVARIANTS v6.0.0 Section X):** AOQ-1 → option (b) (CNN-compatible SSL, not ViT-Large); AOQ-3 retired (no external license); AOQ-4 resolved (both backbones in both arms — symmetric 2×2). AOQ-2 simplified (4-channel SSL pretraining).

Because both ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 now run in both the baseline and the integrated arm, the replication test across architecture families that v5.0 established under fixed ImageNet pretrain is **reinstated** in v6.0.0. EH-4 replication is re-armed (it was suspended under v5.1).

---

## 4.3 Transfer Learning Layer

### EfficientNetB0 — Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Protocol

Backbone: EfficientNetB0 (ImageNet pre-trained)

Two strategies (used as training methods):

**Method 1 — Frozen:**

* Train classification head only

**Method 2 — Progressive Fine-Tuning:**

* Stage 1: Frozen base layers with classification head training
* Stage 2: Unfreeze upper layers for progressive fine-tuning

Expected empirical baseline (self-publications):

* Frozen F1 ≈ 0.62
* Fine-tuned F1 ≈ 0.74

**Note (v2.1):** This protocol is now replicated on EyePACS instead of APTOS 2019. Prior self-publication results (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025, LC-Yesmukhamedov-2025-SELF) constitute the foundational empirical record and must be cited per SIR-4.

### EfficientNet-B4 — Explainability Analysis

Backbone: EfficientNet-B4 (ImageNet pre-trained)

Used in V4 Experiment 4 for Grad-CAM explainability analysis. EfficientNet-B4 provides higher-resolution feature maps suitable for activation visualization and ALO (primary) / IoU (secondary) computation against IDRiD pixel-level lesion masks.

---

# 5. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

## 5.0 Cross-Validation Protocol (Applies to All Experiments)

All experiments use 5-fold cross-validation with patient-level stratified split. For each fold iteration, 4 folds serve as training data and 1 fold as test data. The process is repeated 5 times. All metrics are reported as mean ± standard deviation across folds.

---

## 5.1 Experiment 1 — Causal Improvement (Preprocessing vs. Architecture)

**Purpose [v6.0.0]:** Determine whether the integrated configuration (preprocessing + ophthalmology-specific SSL in-domain pretrain) outperforms the baseline configuration (stretch-resize + ImageNet pretrain) as a unitary system. This is the primary experiment validating H-1 and promoting PC-1.

**Dataset:** EyePACS

**Design (v6.0.0):** A restored 2×2 factorial over *(preprocessing × architecture)*, with the pretraining source slaved to the preprocessing arm (baseline ⟹ ImageNet, integrated ⟹ ophthalmology-specific SSL). Because the SSL initialization is CNN-native, both backbone families appear in both arms.

| Config | Preprocessing | Pretraining source | Backbone | Input channels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | baseline (stretch-resize + ImageNet norm) | ImageNet | ResNet-50 | 3 |
| B | full pipeline | ophthalmology-specific SSL | ResNet-50 | 4 |
| C | baseline (stretch-resize + ImageNet norm) | ImageNet | EfficientNet-B3 | 3 |
| D | full pipeline | ophthalmology-specific SSL | EfficientNet-B3 | 4 |

The v5.1 config **B′** (single full-pipeline + RETFound cell) is **retired** in v6.0.0; the v5.0 designations **B** (full pipeline + ResNet-50) and **D** (full pipeline + EfficientNet-B3) are **reinstated**, now with ophthalmology-SSL initialization in place of ImageNet.

**Dominance validation (v6.0.0):** Integrated Pipeline Dominance is validated if the integrated arm (B, D) outperforms the baseline arm (A, C) — i.e. Performance(B) > Performance(A) and Performance(D) > Performance(C) — with EH-3 criteria satisfied. Attribution of the observed effect to preprocessing alone, pretraining alone, or their interaction is forbidden under CFC-2.8 (INVARIANTS v6.0.0): each cell differs from its baseline counterpart along both the preprocessing and the pretraining axis.

**Config N (normalization control) — retained from v5.0:** Baseline preprocessing + dataset-specific normalization (no pipeline stages). Continues to isolate the normalization statistics effect from other pipeline contributions, with the understanding that the integrated arm also differs in pretrain source (ImageNet → ophthalmology-SSL).

**Known limitations (v6.0.0):**
- The measured H-1 effect conflates (i) preprocessing pipeline stages, (ii) normalization statistics change, and (iii) pretraining source change (ImageNet → ophthalmology-SSL). No single-factor attribution is recoverable from the baseline arm (A/C) vs the integrated arm (B/D) alone; per CFC-2.8 the dominance claim is over the integrated *(preprocessing, pretrain)* pair only.
- Architecture family is **not** confounded: because the SSL initialization is CNN-native, ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3 each appear in both arms (A↔B and C↔D), so the preprocessing+pretraining contrast is read within a fixed backbone. Cross-architecture replication (EH-4) is provided by the two parallel contrasts.

**Statistical analysis:** Mixed-effects model across folds (fold as random effect). McNemar test for paired classification comparison. DeLong test for ROC-AUC comparison. Bonferroni/Holm correction for multiple comparisons.

---

## 5.2 Experiment 2 — Preprocessing Component Ablation

**Purpose:** Quantify the contribution of each preprocessing component to classification performance. Identifies which pipeline stages drive improvement.

**Dataset:** EyePACS

**Architecture:** Best-performing from Experiment 1 (EfficientNet-B3 per preliminary results). Single architecture is sufficient — ablation quantifies stage contributions rather than architecture sensitivity.

**Ablation configurations (7 levels):**

| Level | Pipeline Configuration | Stages Included |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | baseline | stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize (3ch, no FOV mask) |
| 1 | baseline + flip | Stage 0 + stretch-resize + ImageNet norm |
| 2 | +rotation | Stages 0–1 + stretch-resize + ImageNet norm |
| 3 | +isotropic + mask | Stages 0–3 + Stage 7 (dataset-specific norm) |
| 4 | +flat-field | Stages 0–4 + Stage 7 |
| 5 | +CLAHE | Stages 0–5 + Stage 7 |
| 6 | full pipeline | All Stages 0–7 |

**CLAHE parameter sweep:** clip_factor and global_threshold varied on EyePACS to identify sensitivity profile with local optimum (H-2). Stochastic application at 80% train probability.

**Flat-field σ sweep:** σ factor swept from 0.05·D to 0.10·D on EyePACS to characterize illumination normalization sensitivity.

**Metrics:** Primary metrics (Weighted F1, ROC-AUC, Cohen's Kappa, Accuracy) plus image quality metrics (CNR, VVI, Entropy, SSIM) measured at each pipeline stage.

**Statistical analysis:** Bonferroni/Holm correction for multiple comparisons across ablation levels.

---

## 5.3 Experiment 3 — Cross-Dataset Transferability

**Purpose:** Evaluate whether models trained on EyePACS with the pipeline transfer to an independent dataset without retraining.

**Dataset:** Train on EyePACS, evaluate on APTOS 2019 (zero-shot, no retraining).

**Hypothesis tested:** H-4

**Metric:** Generalization ratio G = F1_APTOS / F1_EyePACS. Pre-registered success criterion: G ≥ 0.85.

**Protocol:** Best model from Experiment 1 (config B or D, whichever achieves higher EyePACS F1) is applied to APTOS 2019 test images with no weight updates. F1, AUC, κ reported.

---

## 5.4 Experiment 4 — Explainability Analysis (Grad-CAM / ALO)

**Experiment Number:** 4

**Purpose:** Determine whether preprocessing shifts CNN attention toward clinically relevant lesion regions. Closes the evidential gap in the causal chain: Preprocessing → Improved Feature Visibility → Improved Classification.

**Model:** EfficientNet-B4

**Sampling:** 10 randomly selected images per DR class (50 total). Two pipelines compared:

| Pipeline | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Baseline | stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize only (3ch, no FOV mask) |
| Proposed | full pipeline (all 8 stages, 4ch) |

**Explainability method:** Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping).

**Quantitative evaluation (IDRiD):** Attention–Lesion Overlap (ALO, primary) and Intersection-over-Union (IoU, secondary) between Grad-CAM activation regions and pixel-level lesion masks from the IDRiD dataset. Four lesion types: microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates.

**Qualitative evaluation (Clinical):** Grad-CAM overlays generated for Clinical dataset images as qualitative evidence only (no lesion masks available). 10 images per DR class.

**Hypothesis:** ALO(preprocessing) > ALO(baseline) (primary), IoU(preprocessing) > IoU(baseline) (secondary), demonstrating that preprocessing directs model attention to clinically relevant structures.

**Deliverables:**

* Grad-CAM overlays for representative images from each DR class (0–4) — with vs. without preprocessing (IDRiD)
* ALO scores (primary) and IoU scores (secondary) between Grad-CAM activations and IDRiD pixel-level lesion masks (per lesion type)
* Qualitative Grad-CAM overlays on Clinical dataset images for visual validation

## 5.5 Experiment 5 — External Clinical Performance

**Purpose:** Quantify whether the integrated configuration attains higher absolute performance than baseline on external clinical datasets under zero-shot transfer. [v7.0.0 — the prior purpose, "reduce the performance drop", is retired; see the H-7 reformulation in INVARIANTS v7.0.0.]

**Hypothesis tested:** H-7 (External Clinical Performance)

**Acceptance:** PASS_S on both datasets — Δ wF1(X) = wF1(integrated, X) − wF1(baseline, X) ≥ MCID_wF1 = 0.050 and CI⁻ > 0, evaluated independently per dataset (no aggregation). Δ_drop remains computable as descriptive context but is **not** a criterion.

**Training:** EyePACS (5-fold CV). Evaluation on IDRiD and Messidor-2.

**Protocol:** For each architecture × preprocessing combination (baseline vs integrated), compute:
- wF1_ext(arm) = weighted F1 on the external dataset (IDRiD or Messidor-2), zero-shot
- Δ wF1(X) = wF1_ext(integrated, X) − wF1_ext(baseline, X), with a bootstrap confidence interval
- Δ_drop(arm, X) = wF1_val(arm) − wF1_ext(arm, X) — **descriptive context only, not a criterion**

**Success criterion [v7.0.0]:** PASS_S on **both** datasets — Δ wF1(X) ≥ MCID_wF1 = 0.050 **and** CI⁻ > 0, evaluated independently per dataset (no aggregation; a reversal on either yields REVERSED). The form requires Δ ≥ MCID and CI⁻ > 0; it does **not** require CI⁻ ≥ MCID.

*The prior success criterion — Δ_drop(integrated) < Δ_drop(baseline) — is retired.* It is algebraically degenerate: Δ_drop(integrated) − Δ_drop(baseline) ≡ Δ_in-domain − Δ_external, i.e. the fixed in-domain margin minus the quantity under test. See INVARIANTS v7.0.0.

---

## 5.6 Experiment 6 — Device Domain Shift

**Purpose:** Evaluate whether preprocessing maintains classification performance across images from different fundus camera manufacturers.

**Hypothesis tested:** H-6

**Training:** EyePACS (Canon CR-1). Evaluation on DDR (Canon, Topcon), ODIR-5K (Canon, Zeiss), RFMiD (Topcon, Kowa).

**Protocol:** DR-labeled images only; non-DR disease labels are excluded or mapped to non-DR category. F1 and AUC computed per camera group. Cross-device performance variance reported.

**Deliverables:** Cross-device performance matrix; camera-group F1/AUC bar charts.

---

## 5.7 Experiment 7 — Small Data Training

**Purpose:** Evaluate trainability of the pipeline on a small clinical dataset.

**Training:** IDRiD (516 images), 5-fold cross-validation. Clinical dataset (60 images) held out as test.

**Protocol:** Train on IDRiD folds, evaluate on Clinical held-out. Report mean ± std across 5 folds. Both baseline and preprocessing tested.

**Bootstrap requirement:** Bootstrap CI (≥ 1000 resamples) required given small dataset sizes (IDRiD=516, Clinical=60). See §6.8.

# 6. STATISTICAL VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

## 6.1 Primary Metrics (EH-1)

In descending order of evidentiary weight:

1. Weighted F1-score (accounts for class imbalance)
2. ROC-AUC (threshold-independent performance measure)
3. Cohen's Kappa with quadratic weights (penalizes clinically significant ordinal misclassification)
4. Accuracy (reported but subject to inflation under class imbalance; not sufficient alone)

All primary metrics reported as **mean ± standard deviation** across 5-fold cross-validation.

---

## 6.2 Secondary Metrics

* Per-class F1 (per class Precision and Recall)
* Confusion matrix (normalized, per configuration × dataset)
* Training–Test gap (overfitting threshold = 15 pp)

---

## 6.3 Clinical Screening Metrics

* Sensitivity (for referable DR, grade ≥ 2)
* Specificity (for referable DR, grade ≥ 2)
* Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
* Negative Predictive Value (NPV)

Reported for Experiments 1, 3, and 5.

---

## 6.4 Calibration Metrics

* Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
* Brier Score

Reported for Experiments 1 and 3.

---

## 6.5 Image Quality Metrics

* Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)
* Vessel Visibility Index (VVI)
* Image Entropy
* Structural Similarity (SSIM)

Reported for pipeline analysis in Experiment 2.

---

## 6.6 Explainability Metrics

* **ALO (Attention–Lesion Overlap)** — Primary: `ALO = area(GradCAM ∩ lesion_mask) / area(lesion_mask)` — measures lesion coverage by attention
* **IoU (Intersection-over-Union)** — Secondary: `IoU = area(GradCAM ∩ lesion_mask) / area(GradCAM ∪ lesion_mask)` — measures symmetric spatial precision
* Attention consistency score

Reported for Experiment 4.

---

## 6.7 Generalization Ratio

G = F1_external / F1_EyePACS

Per OD-4. Reported for Experiment 3.

---

## 6.8 Statistical Tests

Mandatory:

* McNemar test (paired classification comparison) — Experiments 1
* DeLong test (ROC-AUC comparison) — Experiments 1 and 3
* 95% confidence intervals (bootstrap ≥ 1000 iterations) — All experiments
* 5-fold cross-validation reporting (mean ± std) — All experiments
* Mixed-effects model for cross-fold analysis (fold as random effect) — Experiment 1
* Bonferroni/Holm correction for multiple comparisons — Experiments 1, 2

# 7. ABLATION PROTOCOL [v6.0.0 amended]

Integrated Pipeline Dominance (Experiment 1 v6.0.0 design — restored 2×2 factorial):

| Config | Preprocessing | Pretraining source | Backbone | Input channels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | baseline (stretch-resize + ImageNet norm) | ImageNet | ResNet-50 | 3 |
| B | full pipeline | ophthalmology-specific SSL | ResNet-50 | 4 |
| C | baseline (stretch-resize + ImageNet norm) | ImageNet | EfficientNet-B3 | 3 |
| D | full pipeline | ophthalmology-specific SSL | EfficientNet-B3 | 4 |

**Dominance validation criterion (v6.0.0):** Integrated Pipeline Dominance is validated if:

* Performance(B) > Performance(A) and Performance(D) > Performance(C)

with EH-3 criteria (Δ weighted F1 ≥ 5 pp; Δ ROC-AUC ≥ 0.02; no Cohen's Kappa degradation) satisfied. Per CFC-2.8 (INVARIANTS v6.0.0), the attribution of the difference to preprocessing alone is forbidden — the dominance claim is over the integrated *(preprocessing, pretrain)* pair only.

# 8. COMPUTATIONAL CONSTRAINT MODEL

Resource-limited defined per OD-6:

* No guaranteed GPU
* <16GB RAM
* Real-time constraint
* Limited network access

All experiments bounded to actual hardware conditions.

---

# 8.5 Implementation Details

Software stack: Python 3.11, PyTorch, Torchvision, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib. Hardware configuration documented at experiment execution time (TBD). See `methods/implementation.md` for full specification.

# 9. RISK CONTROL LAYER

## 9.1 Leakage Control

* No augmented images in validation/test
* No patient overlap across splits (enforced by patient-level 5-fold CV)
* **[v6.2.0] No pretraining leakage:** the integrated-arm SSL corpus (unlabeled EyePACS "test" split, 53,576 images) is disjoint from the Experiment-1 evaluation corpus (the ~35,126 labeled "train" split) by image identity and patient identity (INVARIANTS SB-2.4). Enforced by the disjointness assertions INV-SSL-1 / INV-SSL-2 in the experiments implementation; the 53k corpus is pretraining-only and is never concatenated into the supervised train/val folds.

## 9.2 Overfitting Control

* Early stopping
* Dropout
* Batch normalization
* Weighted loss

## 9.3 Reproducibility

* Fixed random seed
* Fixed augmentation parameters
* Fixed learning rate schedule

# 10. FORMAL NOVELTY LAYER

Novelty does NOT claim:

* Global SOTA
* Clinical deployment validation
* Cross-modality transfer
* Replacement of ophthalmologist
* NC-16: Device certification or regulatory compliance
* NC-17: Universal preprocessing optimality — the component hierarchy is bounded to the tested architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3) and datasets (EyePACS)

Boundaries enforced per SB-1.

Novelty IS:

* 8-stage preprocessing pipeline with FOV mask as explicit stage (Stage 3), adaptive flat-field correction (σ proportional to FOV diameter), dataset-specific normalization, and canonical orientation via OD-fovea rotation normalization
* Formalization of preprocessing dominance hypothesis (validated via 2×2 factorial ablation on two established architectures, 4 configurations A–D)
* Dual-constraint stochastic CLAHE validation within DR multi-class context (LAB color space, dual-constraint clip limit, 80% train-time probability)
* Adaptive flat-field correction (σ = 0.07 × FOV diameter) scaling with per-image geometry
* Dataset-specific channel-wise normalization computed from training set mask=1.0 pixels
* Isotropic resize with centered zero-padding preserving fundus circle geometry
* component ablation (7 levels: baseline → +flip → +rotation → +isotropic+mask → +flat-field → +CLAHE → full pipeline)
* Cross-dataset transferability validation on APTOS 2019 (G ≥ 0.85, zero-shot)
* Grad-CAM explainability with quantitative ALO (primary) and IoU (secondary) against pixel-level lesion masks (IDRiD) and qualitative overlays (Clinical)
* H-7 external clinical performance — the integrated arm exceeds baseline in absolute weighted F1 on IDRiD and Messidor-2 (Δ ≥ MCID 0.050, CI⁻ > 0, both sets)
* Device domain shift evaluation across 4 camera manufacturers (Canon, Topcon, Kowa, Zeiss) on DDR, ODIR-5K, RFMiD
* Architecture constrained to resource-limited environments
