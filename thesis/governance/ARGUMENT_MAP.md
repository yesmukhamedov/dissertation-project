# ARGUMENT MAP
## PhD Dissertation: Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis via Fundus Image Enhancement and CNN Classification
**Candidate:** Yesmukhamedov N.S.
**Document Type:** Formal Claim-Evidence-Dependency Structure
**Version:** 7.1.0 | **Date:** 2026-08-05 | **Binding Reference:** INVARIANTS.md v7.0.0

**v7.1.0 Amendment:** **PC-11 (Domain-Shift Reduction) is added**, in step with the restoration of H-3 (HYPOTHESIS v7.1.0). PC-11 is the programme's only **mechanistic** empirical claim: it asserts that the integrated configuration reduces source-to-target distance in penultimate-layer feature space on ≥ 5 of 6 external corpora, and it supplies the middle term of the central hypothesis's causal chain, which PC-6/PC-9/PC-10 had previously approached only through its consequence. PC-11 depends on PC-1 and feeds PC-6/PC-9/PC-10 explanatorily; it carries an explicit boundary forbidding any magnitude-correspondence inference. Updated: the PC-11 node and the DAG. No existing claim node is altered.

**v7.0.0 Amendment:** PC-10 is reformulated in step with H-7 (INVARIANTS v7.0.0) — *Clinical Degradation Resistance* → *External Clinical Performance*. The claim is now higher absolute weighted F1 on each external clinical dataset (Δ wF1 ≥ MCID 0.050, CI⁻ > 0, both sets, no aggregation); the Δ_drop degradation form is retired to descriptive status and can neither promote nor demote the claim. Updated: PC-10 formal statement and evidence type, SC-10.1, PC-10 strength criteria, the DAG label, and the PC-1 dependency note. No other claim node is affected.

## 0. PARADIGMATIC FRAMING (PC-0)

### PC-0
**Claim ID:** PC-0
**Formal Statement:** The integrated preprocessing-CNN paradigm (P2), in which preprocessing is formalised as an integral component of the diagnostic model, is conceptually more productive than the end-to-end CNN paradigm (P1, of which Gulshan et al. 2016 is the canonical representative — see INVARIANTS v5.3 SB-1.12, SIR-9), for the specific context of five-class diabetic retinopathy classification across heterogeneous fundus imaging conditions, because P2 (i) renders the preprocessing-to-classifier feature-construction step explicit and contestable, (ii) admits controlled experimental comparison against the P1 instantiation under matched conditions, and (iii) supplies a vocabulary in which downstream questions about cross-dataset transfer, device-domain robustness, and explainability can be posed at the level of the integrated model rather than at the level of the network alone.

**Claim Type:** **Methodological / non-empirical.** PC-0 is not tested experimentally. It is argued *discursively* in dissertation chapters 1.4 (Critical Analysis of Existing Systems) and 1.5 (Formulation of the Research Problem), on the basis of (a) the observable methodological practice of the P1 literature corpus (preprocessing deferred to supplements; absence of a controlled preprocessing-vs-architecture decomposition), and (b) the structural argument that an unformalised preprocessing step is not amenable to the kinds of ablation, transfer, and explainability analyses that the dissertation conducts.

**Required Evidence Type:** Methodological argument with literature support, not an experimental result. Supporting literature: Gulshan 2016 (canonical P1 representative); Pratt 2016, Rakhlin 2017, Saxena 2020, Ting 2017, Voets 2019 (P1 tradition); the LITERATURE_INDEX Paradigm column for the broader survey.

**Relationship to PC-1:** PC-0 → PC-1. The empirical experiments under PC-1 (and PC-6 through PC-10) supply evidence *consistent with* paradigm P2 under the specific conditions of the dissertation's dataset architecture and tested backbones. They do **not** universally prove P2 over P1 (such a universal claim is forbidden by CFC-2.1); they show that, within the tested conditions, the P2 instantiation is at least empirically defensible.

**Forbidden formulations** (per CFC-2.9, SIR-1, SIR-9):
- "Gulshan claims preprocessing is unimportant" — not stated in the source.
- "Paradigm P1 is wrong" — universal claim, forbidden by CFC-2.1.
- "We outperform Gulshan" — forbidden by CFC-2.2 in the absence of a direct replication.

**Permitted formulations:**
- "Gulshan et al. (2016) exemplify the methodological practice that this dissertation identifies as paradigm P1."
- "The dissertation's integrated configuration operationalises paradigm P2 and places it under controlled experimental contrast against the P1-instantiation baseline of Experiment 1."
- "Empirical results under PC-1 are interpreted as evidence consistent with P2 within the tested conditions, not as a universal refutation of P1."

## I. MAIN THESIS NODE

**IT-1 (Verbatim from Invariants, Section I):**

> An integrated preprocessing-CNN pipeline — comprising the 8-stage preprocessing system: canonical flip (Stage 0), OD-fovea rotation normalization (Stage 1), FOV crop + isotropic resize to 512×512 with centered zero-padding (Stage 2), FOV mask generation as 4th input channel (Stage 3), adaptive flat-field correction with σ = 0.07 × FOV diameter applied inside mask only (Stage 4), dual-constraint stochastic CLAHE on LAB L-channel (Stage 5), integrated augmentation at train time (Stage 6), and dataset-specific channel-wise normalization (Stage 7) — applied to fundus images sourced from EyePACS (primary training, ~35,126 images), APTOS 2019 (cross-dataset transferability, Experiment 3), IDRiD (explainability and clinical validation), Messidor-2 (clinical degradation evaluation), DDR/ODIR-5K/RFMiD (device domain shift), and a Kazakh clinical dataset (clinical validation), produces statistically measurable improvement in five-class diabetic retinopathy classification performance relative to a baseline CNN trained on images processed with stretch-resize to 512×512 + ImageNet normalize only (3 channels, no FOV mask), under constrained computational conditions defined by hardware limitations operative during experimental execution.

**Scope boundary:**
- Five-stage DR classification (DR 0–4 per standard clinical grading).
- Dataset architecture: EyePACS (~35,126 labeled images, primary training), APTOS 2019 (cross-dataset transferability, Experiment 3), IDRiD (clinical validation with pixel-level lesion annotations), Messidor-2 (clinical degradation evaluation), Clinical (Kazakh medical center validation), RFMiD/DDR/ODIR-5K (device domain shift evaluation across Topcon, Kowa, Canon, Zeiss camera hardware).
- "Improvement" = measurable difference in primary metrics (weighted F1-score, ROC-AUC, Cohen's Kappa, Accuracy) under matched experimental conditions.
- Scope extends to cross-dataset transferability evaluation (APTOS 2019), explainability via Grad-CAM with ALO/IoU against lesion masks (IDRiD) and qualitative overlays (Clinical), clinical degradation resistance (IDRiD, Messidor-2), and device domain shift across camera hardware (RFMiD, DDR, ODIR-5K).
- Does not extend to: general retinal disease classification, other ophthalmological imaging modalities, imaging contexts not representable by the dataset architecture specified above.

## II. PRIMARY CLAIMS (Level 1)

---

### PC-1
**Claim ID:** PC-1
**Formal Statement:** The integrated 8-stage preprocessing pipeline (canonical flip [Stage 0] → OD-fovea rotation normalization [Stage 1] → FOV crop + isotropic resize with zero-padding [Stage 2] → FOV mask generation as 4th channel [Stage 3] → adaptive flat-field correction σ = 0.07·D [Stage 4] → dual-constraint stochastic CLAHE on LAB L-channel [Stage 5] → augmentation at train time [Stage 6] → dataset-specific normalization [Stage 7]) produces statistically measurable improvement in five-class DR classification performance relative to a baseline CNN trained on images processed with stretch-resize to 512×512 + ImageNet normalize only (3 channels, no FOV mask) from EyePACS, independently for both ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3, on the metrics: weighted F1-score, ROC-AUC, Cohen's Kappa, and Accuracy.
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** 2×2 factorial ablation on EyePACS (Experiment 1); four configurations — (A) baseline + ResNet-50 (3ch), (B) full pipeline + ResNet-50 (4ch), (C) baseline + EfficientNet-B3 (3ch), (D) full pipeline + EfficientNet-B3 (4ch); 5-fold cross-validation with patient-level stratified split; mixed-effects model. Preprocessing dominance validated if Performance(B) > Performance(A) AND Performance(D) > Performance(C) with EH-3 criteria satisfied independently for both architectures.
**Dependency:** None (foundational claim; corresponds to H-1)
**Tests whether:** Preprocessing improves CNN performance independently of architecture.

---

### PC-2
**Claim ID:** PC-2
**Formal Statement:** The CLAHE dual-constraint clip limit parameters (clip_factor and global_threshold), varied across controlled values within the tested range on EyePACS, produce a parameter-dependent sensitivity profile in downstream CNN classification performance, with at least one identifiable local optimum within the tested range, particularly in per-class F1-score for DR 1 and DR 2 (microaneurysm and small vessel features). CLAHE is applied in LAB color space with dual-constraint clip limit. Additionally, flat-field σ factor is swept from 0.05·D to 0.10·D on EyePACS to characterize illumination normalization sensitivity.
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Parameter sweep experiment; per-class F1-score across clip limit values; EyePACS as the CLAHE threshold sensitivity and flat-field σ sweep test dataset.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (CLAHE is a component of the pipeline validated in PC-1)
**Tests whether:** CLAHE clip limit exhibits a parameter-dependent sensitivity profile with an identifiable optimum.

---


### PC-4
**Claim ID:** PC-4
**Formal Statement:** A coupled thermal-optical mathematical model of laser-fundus tissue interaction — comprising Beer's law for radiation attenuation, an energy balance equation, and the general heat conduction equation solved by finite difference methods — provides a theoretical computational grounding for the thermal effects of laser coagulation on retinal tissue layers (cornea, choroid, retina). This model provides qualitative support for diagnostic image feature interpretation in the context of laser-treated retinopathy. The model does not constitute an experimentally validated clinical model.
**Claim Type:** Theoretical
**Required Evidence Type:** Mathematical derivation; computational simulation results; qualitative heat map outputs for three tissue layers.
**Dependency:** None (independent theoretical contribution; does not condition PC-1 or PC-2)

---

### PC-5
**Claim ID:** PC-5
**Formal Statement:** A modular, scalable AI-driven information system architecture — specifying components for image capture, preprocessing, inference, reporting, data management, PACS/EHR integration, and physician-in-the-loop decision support — constitutes a design specification for automated DR screening deployable in resource-limited environments. The architecture has not been prototype-implemented or field-tested. All stated deployment benefits are design specifications, not demonstrated outcomes.
**Claim Type:** System-level
**Required Evidence Type:** UML architecture diagrams; component specification; comparative analysis of existing DR screening systems; design feasibility framing for Kazakhstan healthcare context.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (the preprocessing-CNN pipeline validated in PC-1 constitutes the AI processing module of the architecture)

---

### PC-6
**Claim ID:** PC-6
**Formal Statement:** Models trained on EyePACS with the full preprocessing pipeline generalize to APTOS 2019 without retraining, achieving generalization ratio G = F1_APTOS / F1_EyePACS ≥ 0.85 per OD-4.
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Experiment 3 — cross-dataset transferability evaluation. Best model from Experiment 1 (config B or D) applied to APTOS 2019 without retraining; generalization ratio G computed.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (pipeline must be validated before transferability is tested)
**Tests whether:** The preprocessing pipeline enables cross-dataset generalization without retraining.

---

### PC-7
**Claim ID:** PC-7
**Formal Statement:** Grad-CAM analysis on EfficientNet-B4 demonstrates that models trained with the preprocessing pipeline exhibit higher Attention–Lesion Overlap (ALO) and higher IoU between activation regions and IDRiD pixel-level lesion masks (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates) than models trained with stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize baseline (3ch). ALO = area(GradCAM ∩ lesion_mask) / area(lesion_mask) is the **primary** explainability metric (measures lesion coverage by attention); IoU = area(GradCAM ∩ lesion_mask) / area(GradCAM ∪ lesion_mask) is the **secondary** metric (measures symmetric spatial precision). Hypothesis: ALO_preprocessing > ALO_baseline (primary), IoU_preprocessing > IoU_baseline (secondary). Qualitative Grad-CAM overlays additionally generated on the Kazakh clinical dataset.
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Experiment 4 — Grad-CAM explainability analysis. ALO (primary) and IoU (secondary) between Grad-CAM activation maps and IDRiD lesion masks computed per lesion type for preprocessing vs. baseline conditions on EfficientNet-B4. Qualitative overlays on Clinical dataset.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (preprocessing pipeline validity)
**Tests whether:** Preprocessing directs CNN attention toward clinically relevant lesion regions.

---

### PC-8
**Claim ID:** PC-8
**Formal Statement:** Component-level ablation of the pipeline identifies a ranked contribution hierarchy among the stages, measured by incremental weighted F1 improvement on EyePACS. The ablation proceeds through seven levels:
- Level 0: baseline — stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize (3ch, no FOV mask)
- Level 1: baseline + canonical flip (Stage 0)
- Level 2: +OD-fovea rotation normalization (Stage 1)
- Level 3: +isotropic resize + FOV mask (Stages 2–3, 4ch)
- Level 4: +flat-field correction (Stage 4)
- Level 5: +CLAHE (Stage 5)
- Level 6: full pipeline (all Stages 0–7)

**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Experiment 2 — component-level ablation. Sequential addition of individual pipeline stages; weighted F1 measured at each ablation level (Levels 0–6) on EyePACS. Image quality metrics (CNR, VVI, Entropy, SSIM) also measured at each level.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (full pipeline must be established before component-level ablation is meaningful)
**Tests whether:** Individual preprocessing stages contribute differentially to classification performance.

---

### PC-9
**Claim ID:** PC-9
**Formal Statement:** Models trained on EyePACS with the preprocessing pipeline maintain classification performance across images from different fundus camera manufacturers (Canon, Topcon, Kowa, Zeiss), as evaluated on DDR, ODIR-5K, and RFMiD subsets grouped by camera model. DR labels only; non-DR disease labels are ignored or mapped to non-DR. Preprocessing standardizes retinal image appearance and reduces inter-device distribution shift, thereby improving cross-device generalization.
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Experiment 6 — device domain shift evaluation. F1-score and ROC-AUC computed per camera group across DDR (Canon, Topcon), ODIR-5K (Canon, Zeiss), and RFMiD (Topcon, Kowa).
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (pipeline validity) and PC-6 (cross-database generalization established)
**Tests whether:** Preprocessing standardizes retinal image appearance and reduces device-induced distribution shift across camera manufacturers.

---

---

### PC-10
**Claim ID:** PC-10
**Formal Statement:** On each external clinical dataset (IDRiD, Messidor-2), evaluated without retraining, the weighted F1-score of the integrated-preprocessed model exceeds that of the baseline (stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize) by at least MCID_wF1 = 0.050 with the confidence interval of the difference excluding zero. [v7.0.0 reformulated — the retired Δ_drop degradation form is descriptive only.]
**Claim Type:** Empirical
**Required Evidence Type:** Experiment 5 — external clinical evaluation. Δ wF1 with bootstrap CI computed per dataset per architecture; both datasets must pass independently (no aggregation).
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (pipeline validity)
**Tests whether:** Preprocessing yields higher absolute performance on external clinical data (H-7). **Does not test** degradation resistance — see the v7.0.0 amendment in INVARIANTS/HYPOTHESIS.

---

### PC-11
**Claim ID:** PC-11
**Formal Statement:** For at least five of the six external corpora {APTOS 2019, IDRiD, Messidor-2, DDR, ODIR-5K, RFMiD}, the distance between the source (EyePACS) and target feature distributions at the penultimate layer is smaller under the integrated configuration than under the baseline — Δd(X) = d(BASE, X) − d(INT, X) ≥ MCID_d = 0.0 with CI⁻(Δd) > 0 — where Stage 7 normalization is computed from source-domain statistics. [v7.1.0 added, with H-3.]
**Claim Type:** Empirical — **mechanistic**
**Required Evidence Type:** H-3 domain-shift measurement. MMD (or FID) over penultimate-layer features as the primary metric, with 1 000-resample bootstrap CIs on the paired reduction; forward passes only, no training. KL over per-channel intensity histograms is secondary and informational, carrying no part of the criterion.
**Dependency:** Depends on PC-1 (pipeline validity). **Feeds** PC-6, PC-9 and PC-10 as the mechanistic account of why external performance holds — but see the boundary below.
**Tests whether:** The pipeline reduces source-to-target domain distance in the representation the classifier consumes — the middle term of the central hypothesis's causal chain, which PC-6/PC-9/PC-10 had previously approached only through its consequence.
**Boundary:** PC-11 establishes **that** the mechanism operates. It does **not** establish that the magnitude of the distance reduction predicts the magnitude of any performance gain, and no downstream claim may rest on such a correspondence. It is not a claim of diagnostic performance, device compatibility (NC-16) or clinical utility. Because d is computed over model-dependent features, the two arms' distances are measured in different representation spaces; the comparison is of a target corpus's relative remoteness within each arm's own space.

### SC-1.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-1
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-1.1
**Formal Statement:** Fundus image preprocessing combining resizing to 512×512, pixel normalization to [0,1], CLAHE (clip limit 2.0, grid 8×8), and augmentation (horizontal/vertical flip, rotation ±15°, zoom ±10%, brightness variation) raises validation accuracy from 71% to 86% and classification accuracy from 88% to 91% relative to no-preprocessing baseline on the APTOS 2019 and supplementary clinical dataset.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, Extraction Block EB-LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01-01
- Dissertation Section: §4.2 (Experiment 1: Baseline CNN vs. Enhanced CNN)
- Dataset: APTOS 2019 + supplementary clinical images (25,000 labeled images; 80/10/10 split)
- Metrics: Validation accuracy (71% → 86%); Classification accuracy (88% → 91%); Weighted F1 = 0.91; ROC-AUC = 0.9638 (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, p. 84)

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Results are bounded to the APTOS 2019 image distribution and the specific pipeline parameters cited.
- Supplementary clinical dataset is not publicly available; reproducibility is structurally limited (SB-2.2).
- Hardware overheating constrained epoch count; full learning potential may not have been reached (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, p. 86).
- Binary classification performance reported in Figs. 4–5 of LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01; multiclass performance relationship requires explicit clarification in dissertation (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, II.7 Assumption 3).

### SC-1.2
**Parent Claim:** PC-1
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-1.2
**Formal Statement:** The enhanced four-block CNN (filters: 32–256, batch normalization, dropout 0.4, softmax 5-class, Adam lr=0.0001, categorical cross-entropy) achieves 94.5% training accuracy and 91.3% validation accuracy, converging within 35–40 epochs, with validation loss stabilizing at 0.18–0.20, compared to the baseline two-block CNN (32–64 filters, sigmoid, binary cross-entropy) stabilizing at validation loss 0.27–0.30.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, §II.5
- Dissertation Section: §4.2.1 (Training Dynamics and Convergence Analysis)
- Dataset: APTOS 2019 + supplementary clinical images
- Metrics: Training accuracy 94.5%; Validation accuracy 91.3% (Epoch 9: val_acc 93.41%, val_loss 0.1833 vs. baseline val_acc 91.71%, val_loss 0.2288) (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, p. 86, Table 2)

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Results are bounded to the specific hyperparameter configuration documented (Adam, lr=0.0001, batch 32, dropout 0.4, early stopping).
- Hardware-specific computational constraints apply (DGL-2).
- Training accuracy significantly exceeds test accuracy on Method 1 in parallel EfficientNetB0 experiment; overfitting remains a documented risk (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025, p. 499; LC-Yesmukhamedov-2025-SELF, p. 119).

---

---

### SC-1.4
**Parent Claim:** PC-1
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-1.4
**Formal Statement:** The APTOS 2019 dataset exhibits severe class imbalance (Class 0: 73.5% training / 49.3% test; Classes 3 and 4: 4.5% combined training / 13.3% combined test), which constitutes a primary confounding factor in the interpretation of accuracy-based performance claims and necessitates weighted F1-score and Cohen's Kappa as primary evaluation metrics.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025, §II.3 (p. 498); LC-Yesmukhamedov-2025-SELF, §II.3; LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, §II.3
- Dissertation Section: §4.1.2 (Class Distribution Analysis)
- Dataset: APTOS 2019
- Metric: Class distribution (percentage per class, training and test partitions)

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Class imbalance figures are specific to the APTOS 2019 + supplementary clinical dataset split as documented in the cited sources.
- Per-class precision and recall for minority classes (DR 3, DR 4) are subject to instability under severe imbalance (EH-2).

---

### SC-2.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-2
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-2.1
**Formal Statement:** The upgraded CLAHE uses a dual-constraint clip limit formulation: clip_limit = min(clip_factor × tile_area / 256, global_threshold × tile_area), applied stochastically at train time (80% probability) on the L-channel of LAB color space. This formulation provides controllable adaptive contrast enhancement that addresses excessive enhancement artifacts and poor manifestation of small vessels and microaneurysm-like features in fundus images. The T/80 formulation from LC-AlTimemy-2021 (proposed as an upgrade to conventional CLAHE: CLIP LIMIT = ⌈L/T⌉ + β·(φ−⌈L/T⌉)) serves as historical theoretical context; uses the independent dual-constraint parameterization (clip_factor and global_threshold) validated within the dissertation's own experimental framework.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-AlTimemy-2021, §3 (Equation 2, p. 5); §4 (Conceptual Contributions)
- Dissertation Section: §3.1.2 (Modified CLAHE Algorithm with Simplified Threshold Control); §4.3 (Experiment 2: Modified CLAHE Threshold Optimization)
- Dataset: STARE (LC-AlTimemy-2021 context: 157 images, five-class taxonomy); APTOS 2019 (dissertation validation)
- Metric: Per-class F1-score for DR 1 and DR 2; classification accuracy

**Boundary Conditions:**
- CLAHE T/80 formulation was derived on STARE dataset with different image characteristics and different five-class taxonomy (BDR, CRVO, CNV, PDR, Normal ≠ DR 0–4). No parameter-level equivalence between STARE-optimized and APTOS-optimized parameters is asserted (DGL-5).
- The sensitivity formula in LC-AlTimemy-2021 (Eq. 3: Sen = TP/(TP+TN)) deviates from standard (TP/(TP+FN)); this anomaly must be noted if that source's sensitivity figure is cited (SIR-3).
- 100% accuracy reported in LC-AlTimemy-2021 is not transferable to the dissertation's APTOS 2019 framework (SB-1.2).
- CLAHE parameters must be independently validated within the dissertation's experimental framework (DGL-5).

---

### SC-2.2
**Parent Claim:** PC-2
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-2.2
**Formal Statement:** Within the CLAHE clip limit range tested experimentally on EyePACS, downstream CNN classification performance on per-class F1-score for DR 1 and DR 2 exhibits a parameter-dependent sensitivity profile. The profile has at least one local optimum identifiable within the tested range. No extrapolation to untested parameter values is permissible.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, §II.3 (CLAHE parameters: clip limit 2.0, grid 8×8); LC-AlTimemy-2021, §3
- Dissertation Section: §4.3.1 (Threshold Parameter Sensitivity Analysis); §4.3.2 (Impact on Feature Preservation)
- Dataset: Small fundus image dataset (experiment-specific; bounded per Invariants H-2)
- Metric: Per-class F1-score, DR 1 and DR 2 classes

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Claim is bounded strictly to the parameter range tested experimentally (Invariants H-2).
- Extrapolation to clip limit values outside the tested range is forbidden (CFC-1.2).

---

### SC-4.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-4
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-4.1
**Formal Statement:** The heat conduction equation Coσ(x,y,z,T)∂T/∂t = div(k(x,y,z,T)·grad(T)), combined with Beer's law for laser intensity attenuation I(r,z) = I₀(r)e^(−∫₀ᶻβ(r,ξ)dξ) and a Gaussian beam intensity profile I₀(r) = (P/πa²)e^(−(r/a)²), provides a mathematical framework for numerically modeling temperature distribution across retinal tissue layers (cornea, choroid, retina) during laser coagulation. Surface layers (cornea) exhibit faster temperature rise than deeper layers (choroid, retina). Temperature stabilizes in deep layers after continued laser exposure.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.3 (Equations 2, 3, 4, 7, 8); §II.5
- Dissertation Section: §2.4.1 (Coupled Thermal-Optical Model of Fundus Tissue Response)
- Dataset: Simulation only (no clinical data; no APTOS 2019 involvement)
- Metric: Qualitative temperature distribution (heat maps; depth-time graphs); no quantitative temperature thresholds reported

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Results are computational simulation only. No quantitative validation against experimental or clinical data exists (LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.5; SIR-6).
- Model omits blood perfusion term despite Pennes bioheat equation reference in source introduction (LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.7 Assumption 4).
- Tissue optical and thermal properties treated as static during exposure; no temperature-dependent modification modeled (LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.7 Assumption 1).
- The claim that simulation "confirms effectiveness of laser therapy" is the source's claim; it is not absorbed into dissertation's validated findings (SIR-6; CFC-2.4).

**Formal Statement:** A modular AI-driven diagnostic system architecture for ophthalmological screening — specifying components including Image Capture, Image Processing, Recognition Model, Diagnosis, Reporting, User Interface, Data Storage, Error Handling, and a Doctor-AI Feedback Loop — can be formally specified using UML component, sequence, class, activity, and ER diagrams. This specification addresses functional and non-functional requirements for deployment in resource-limited environments including PACS/EHR integration, telemedicine support, and physician-in-the-loop decision support.

### SC-5.2
**Parent Claim:** PC-5
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-5.2
**Formal Statement:** Existing commercial DR screening systems (IDx-DR, EyeNuk, DeepMind, Retina-AI Health, Visulytix Pegasus, ZEISS VISUHEALTH, NVIDIA Clara AI, Orbis Cybersight AI, Heidelberg AI Tools) exhibit identified limitations (data security dependencies, internet connectivity requirements, lack of adaptation to local datasets, infrastructure prerequisites) that the proposed system architecture design explicitly addresses in its specification.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Literature Card: LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, §II.3 (comparative analysis, Table 1, pp. 80–81)
- Dissertation Section: §1.4 (Critical Analysis of Existing DR Screening Systems); §5.3 (Comparative Analysis with Existing DR Diagnostic Systems)
- Dataset: Published system specifications and peer-reviewed performance reports (external benchmarks; no direct controlled experiment)
- Metric: Qualitative comparative analysis; tabular decomposition

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The comparison is qualitative and based on published specifications, not a controlled experiment against named systems under identical evaluation conditions (CFC-2.2).
- Claims of superiority over existing systems without direct controlled comparison are forbidden (CFC-2.2).
- Published performance metrics of existing systems (e.g., IDx-DR sensitivity ≥ 96%) are cited as external benchmarks, not as validated results of this dissertation (LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, §II.5).

### SC-6.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-6
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-6.1
**Formal Statement:** Generalization ratio G = F1_APTOS / F1_EyePACS is computed for models trained on EyePACS with the preprocessing pipeline and evaluated without retraining on APTOS 2019. Specific G value constitutes the primary evidence for PC-6.

**Boundary Conditions:**
- No retraining is performed on APTOS 2019; results are bounded to the tested preprocessing configuration and trained model weights.
- G ≥ 0.85 is a pre-registered success criterion, not a guaranteed outcome (Invariants H-4).

### SC-7.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-7
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-7.1
**Formal Statement:** ALO (primary) and IoU (secondary) between Grad-CAM activation regions and IDRiD pixel-level lesion masks are computed per lesion type (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, soft exudates) for EfficientNet-B4 models trained with preprocessing vs. stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize baseline (3ch). ALO(preprocessing) > ALO(baseline) constitutes the primary quantitative evidence for PC-7; IoU(preprocessing) > IoU(baseline) constitutes secondary evidence. Additionally, qualitative Grad-CAM overlays are generated on the Kazakh Clinical dataset for visual validation.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Dissertation Section: Experiment 4 (Grad-CAM Explainability Analysis)
- Dataset: IDRiD (pixel-level lesion annotations, quantitative); Clinical dataset (Grad-CAM overlays, qualitative)
- Metrics: ALO per lesion type (primary — measures lesion coverage by attention); IoU per lesion type (secondary — measures symmetric spatial precision); qualitative Grad-CAM overlays on Clinical

**Boundary Conditions:**
- IoU is an interpretability metric, not clinical localization — Grad-CAM activation does not constitute diagnostic delineation of lesion boundaries (NC-14).
- Results are bounded to EfficientNet-B4 architecture; generalization to other architectures (e.g., ResNet-50) is not asserted without additional experiments.

---

### SC-8.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-8
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-8.1
**Formal Statement:** Component-level ablation produces weighted F1 measurements at each of seven ablation levels on EyePACS: Level 0 (baseline: stretch-resize + ImageNet normalize, 3ch) → Level 1 (+canonical flip) → Level 2 (+OD-fovea rotation) → Level 3 (+isotropic resize + FOV mask, 4ch) → Level 4 (+flat-field correction) → Level 5 (+CLAHE) → Level 6 (full pipeline). This identifies a ranked contribution hierarchy among the pipeline stages.
**Evidence Reference:**
- Dissertation Section: Experiment 2 (Component-Level Ablation)
- Dataset: EyePACS
- Metrics: Weighted F1-score at each ablation level; incremental F1 improvement per component addition

**Boundary Conditions:**
- The component hierarchy is bounded to the tested architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3) and datasets (EyePACS) (NC-17).
- Component interactions may mean individual contributions are not strictly additive; the hierarchy reflects sequential addition ordering, not isolated effects.

---

### SC-9.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-9
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-9.1
**Formal Statement:** Cross-camera performance is evaluated via F1-score and ROC-AUC per camera group (Canon, Topcon, Kowa, Zeiss) across DDR, ODIR-5K, and RFMiD subsets, producing a cross-device performance matrix for models trained on EyePACS with the preprocessing pipeline. DR labels only; non-DR disease labels are excluded or mapped to non-DR.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Dissertation Section: Experiment 6 (Device Domain Shift)
- Dataset: DDR (Canon/Topcon), ODIR-5K (Canon/Zeiss), RFMiD (Topcon/Kowa) — subsets grouped by camera model
- Metrics: F1-score, ROC-AUC per camera group; cross-device performance variance

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Device domain shift results do not constitute device certification or regulatory compliance (NC-16).
- Results are bounded to the specific camera models represented in the tested datasets (Invariants H-6).
- Camera-specific image characteristics beyond preprocessing scope (e.g., sensor noise profiles, optical characteristics) may remain unaddressed.

---

---

### SC-10.1
**Parent Claim:** PC-10
**Sub-Claim ID:** SC-10.1
**Formal Statement:** For each architecture (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3), Δ wF1(X) = wF1(integrated, X) − wF1(baseline, X) is computed on both IDRiD and Messidor-2. PASS_S on both — Δ wF1(X) ≥ 0.050 and CI⁻ > 0 — establishes higher absolute external clinical performance.

**Evidence Reference:**
- Dissertation Section: Experiment 5 (External Clinical Performance)
- Dataset: EyePACS (training), IDRiD and Messidor-2 (external evaluation, zero-shot)
- Metrics: Δ wF1 with bootstrap CI per dataset per architecture; sets evaluated independently

**Boundary Conditions:**
- Claim is bounded to the tested datasets (IDRiD, Messidor-2) and architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3), zero-shot with no target-domain adaptation.
- Claims higher absolute performance only. **Does not claim** reduced degradation, reduced proportional drop, or resistance to domain shift.
- Acceptance requires Δ ≥ MCID and CI⁻ > 0; it does **not** require CI⁻ ≥ MCID.

## IV. COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND LIMITATIONS

---

### PC-1: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-1.1:**
Claim: Preprocessing improvement may be confounded by simultaneous architectural change. In LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, preprocessing (pipeline activation) and architectural complexity increase (two-block → four-block CNN) are applied together in the enhanced condition. The isolated effect of preprocessing versus architectural complexity change is not independently measured.
Source: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, §II.7 Assumption 3; dissertation §5.2 (ablation study required).
Condition of Failure: If ablation study (§5.2) demonstrates that architectural complexity alone accounts for performance gains, the preprocessing dominance claim weakens to conditional status.

**Counter-Argument CA-1.2:**
Claim: Test performance is evaluated on a non-public supplementary dataset that cannot be independently reproduced.
Source: LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01, §II.6 Limitation 1; SB-2.2.
Condition of Failure: If results do not replicate on APTOS 2019 public partition alone, generalizability is structurally limited.

**Counter-Argument CA-1.3:**
Claim: Accuracy metric is subject to inflation under class imbalance (Class 0: 49.3%–73.5%); a classifier assigning all images to Class 0 could achieve ~49–73% accuracy without learning DR-relevant features.
Source: Invariants §V (EH-1); SB-2.1.
Condition of Failure: If weighted F1 and Cohen's Kappa do not satisfy EH-3 thresholds, accuracy-based claims do not constitute evidence of preprocessing dominance.

---

### PC-2: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-2.1:**
Claim: The T/80 CLAHE formulation was derived on STARE (157 images, different disease taxonomy) and is not directly validated for APTOS 2019 five-class DR staging without independent parameter optimization.
Source: DGL-5; LC-AlTimemy-2021, §3.
Condition of Failure: If clip limit optimum on APTOS 2019 differs substantially from T/80 formulation, the source cannot be used as direct parameter justification.

**Counter-Argument CA-2.2:**
Claim: Sensitivity formula anomaly in LC-AlTimemy-2021 (Sen = TP/(TP+TN) vs. standard TP/(TP+FN)) may undermine the credibility of that source's 100% accuracy/sensitivity claims.
Source: LC-AlTimemy-2021, Eq. 3, p. 9; SIR-3.
Condition of Failure: If the 100% accuracy claim is methodologically flawed due to metric formula error, the source's empirical results cannot be cited as evidence of CLAHE effectiveness.

---

### PC-4: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-4.1:**
Claim: The mathematical model lacks quantitative experimental validation against physical or clinical data. Temperature distribution results are qualitative only; no numerical thresholds, error margins, or calibration against measured tissue temperatures are reported.
Source: LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.5; §II.6; SIR-6.
Condition of Failure: This claim fails as an empirical or clinical contribution. It is bounded to its status as a theoretical/computational contribution.

**Counter-Argument CA-4.2:**
Claim: The model omits blood perfusion (Pennes bioheat term), despite its relevance to retinal tissue thermal dynamics, and uses static tissue optical properties despite coagulation-induced property changes during laser exposure.
Source: LC-Sapakova-2024-01, §II.7 Assumptions 1, 4.
Condition of Failure: Model predictions may deviate significantly from physical reality in vivo; the dissertation must restrict its use of this model to "theoretical/computational grounding" (SIR-6).

---

### PC-5: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-5.1:**
Claim: The system architecture has not been prototype-implemented or field-tested. All stated benefits (diagnostic accuracy improvement, telemedicine reach, cost reduction) are design-level projections, not demonstrated results.
Source: SB-4.1; DGL-4; LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, §II.7.
Condition of Failure: Any claim framing the architecture as a demonstrated system, as a clinically validated tool, or as an infrastructure with certified compliance fails per CFC-2.3, CFC-2.4, SB-4.2.

**Counter-Argument CA-5.2:**
Claim: The projected deployment outcomes for Kazakhstan (4+ million rural residents accessed; 20–30% late-stage DR complication reduction; 15–20% cost reduction) are third-party projections cited by LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, not results of this dissertation. They cannot be attributed to dissertation findings.
Source: SIR-8; SB-1.6; CFC-2.3; LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, p. 88.
Condition of Failure: Attribution of these figures to dissertation findings constitutes a forbidden claim type (CFC-2.3).

---

### PC-6: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-6.1:**
Claim: Distribution shift between EyePACS and APTOS 2019 — arising from differences in imaging equipment, patient demographics, grading protocols, and image quality — may degrade performance beyond the G ≥ 0.85 threshold.
Source: SB-2.3; Invariants H-4.
Condition of Failure: If G < 0.85 on APTOS 2019, PC-6 fails.

**Counter-Argument CA-6.2:**
Claim: APTOS 2019 uses mixed camera hardware; domain shift may vary by camera subgroup within the dataset, making the aggregate G metric sensitive to dataset composition.
Source: APTOS 2019 dataset documentation; Invariants H-4 scope.
Condition of Failure: If the G ≥ 0.85 threshold cannot be attributed to preprocessing rather than confounds (e.g., overlap in image characteristics), the generalization claim is weakened.

---

### PC-7: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-7.1:**
Claim: Grad-CAM is architecture-dependent — activation maps are computed from the final convolutional layer of the specific architecture. Results on EfficientNet-B4 may not generalize to ResNet-50 or other architectures with different feature hierarchies and receptive field sizes.
Source: Grad-CAM methodology constraints; Invariants H-5 scope.
Condition of Failure: If IoU patterns differ substantially across architectures, the explainability claim is bounded to EfficientNet-B4 only.

**Counter-Argument CA-7.2:**
Claim: IoU with lesion masks measures spatial overlap between activation regions and annotated lesion areas, not causal feature importance. High IoU indicates co-localization, not that the model uses lesion features causally for classification.
Source: NC-14; Grad-CAM interpretability limitations.
Condition of Failure: IoU evidence supports an interpretability claim only; it cannot establish that preprocessing causally directs model attention to lesion regions in a mechanistic sense.

---

### PC-8: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-8.1:**
Claim: Component interactions may mean individual contributions are not additive — removing one component may affect others non-linearly. Sequential ablation measures the contribution of each component conditional on the presence of all preceding components, not its isolated effect.
Source: Experiment 2 methodology constraints; ablation design limitations.
Condition of Failure: If component ordering significantly affects the measured hierarchy (i.e., different ablation orderings produce different rankings), the identified hierarchy is ordering-dependent, not intrinsic.

---

### PC-9: Counter-Arguments and Limitations

**Counter-Argument CA-9.1:**
Claim: Camera-specific image characteristics beyond preprocessing scope — such as sensor noise profiles, optical characteristics, dynamic range, and color response — may remain unaddressed by the preprocessing pipeline. Performance variability across camera groups may reflect residual device-specific artifacts not corrected by preprocessing.
Source: Invariants H-6 scope; SB-1.8.
Condition of Failure: If performance variance across camera groups exceeds acceptable bounds despite preprocessing, the pipeline's device-domain robustness claim is weakened.

**Dependency Rules:**
- PC-0 is methodological and supplies the *conceptual context* for PC-1 and its dependants. PC-0 is not falsified by adverse empirical outcomes on PC-1; instead, PC-1's empirical result feeds back as evidence consistent or inconsistent with P2 *under the tested conditions*. Adverse PC-1 outcomes weaken PC-0's empirical support but do not refute it universally (per CFC-2.1).
- PC-2 requires PC-1 to be validated: CLAHE is embedded in the pipeline of PC-1; parameter sensitivity testing presupposes the pipeline's demonstrated effectiveness.
- PC-5 requires PC-1 for its AI processing module justification. If PC-1 fails, the architecture's core preprocessing-CNN module lacks experimental grounding.
- PC-4 is independent of PC-1, PC-2, PC-5. Its failure or success does not condition any other primary claim.
- PC-6 requires PC-1: cross-dataset transferability is only meaningful if the pipeline has been validated on the primary dataset (EyePACS).
- PC-7 requires PC-1 (pipeline validity). IDRiD supplies lesion masks; Clinical supplies qualitative context.
- PC-8 requires PC-1: component-level ablation presupposes an established full pipeline whose components can be systematically removed.
- PC-9 requires PC-1 (pipeline validity); evaluation on DDR, ODIR-5K, RFMiD grouped by camera.
- PC-10 requires PC-1 (pipeline validity); external clinical performance is only meaningful after pipeline dominance is established.
- EH-4 (Sufficient Validation Criterion) requires PC-1 to be satisfied on EyePACS AND confirmed in direction of effect on at least one external dataset (APTOS 2019, IDRiD, or Messidor-2) AND replicated across both architectures in the factorial design (ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B3). PC-6 contributes the cross-dataset confirmation required by EH-4.

## VI. CLAIM STRENGTH CLASSIFICATION

---

### PC-1 — Preprocessing Dominance
**Strength: MODERATE**
**Justification:**
- Direct experimental evidence exists (LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01): validation accuracy 71% → 86%; classification accuracy 88% → 91%; ROC-AUC = 0.9638; Weighted F1 = 0.91.
- Evidence satisfies EH-3 criteria direction (weighted F1 Δ ≥ 5 pp; ROC-AUC ≥ 0.9638) on the dataset tested.
- Strength is MODERATE rather than STRONG because: (a) preprocessing and architectural complexity change are confounded in the existing source (SC-1.1 boundary); (b) supplementary clinical dataset is non-public (SB-2.2); (c) ablation study isolating preprocessing from architectural change is required for Strong classification and is not yet documented in a separate independent source; (d) binary vs. five-class classification ambiguity exists in LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01 reporting (SC-1.1 boundary).
- Promotion to STRONG requires: Experiment 1 ablation on EyePACS with 2×2 factorial design (ResNet-50 + EfficientNet-B3), satisfying EH-3 independently for both architectures, with 5-fold cross-validation and mixed-effects model.

---

### PC-2 — CLAHE Threshold Sensitivity
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- The T/80 formulation is established in LC-AlTimemy-2021 on STARE; however, metric formula anomaly in that source (Sen = TP/(TP+TN)) weakens confidence in its 100% performance claims.
- CLAHE parameters (clip limit 2.0, grid 8×8) are documented in LC-SAPAKOVA-2025-01 as producing improved classification, but no explicit parameter sweep across clip limit values is documented in the available literature cards.
- Dissertation §4.3 is the primary evidence source for SC-2.2. Until those experimental results are produced and validated within the dissertation, claim strength is CONDITIONAL on experimental execution.
- Claim fails if no identifiable optimum is found within the tested range, per H-2 falsification requirement (Invariants VCR-3).

---

### PC-4 — Laser-Tissue Mathematical Model
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- The mathematical equations are standard (Beer's law, heat conduction, Gaussian beam) applied to fundus tissue layers; they are not contested as formulations.
- The claim is bounded to theoretical/computational grounding status per SIR-6 and SB-1.5.
- CONDITIONAL: valid as a theoretical claim within its bounded scope (computational simulation; qualitative results). Fails if claimed as empirically or clinically validated (CFC-2.4; SIR-6).
- No quantitative validation data exists; this constraint is permanent under current evidence.

---

### PC-5 — System Architecture
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- The architecture design is formally specified in LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01 with UML diagrams, component specifications, and comparative analysis. As a design claim, it is well-documented.
- CONDITIONAL: valid as a design/conceptual claim only. Fails if asserted as a deployed, prototype-validated, or clinically tested system (SB-4.1; DGL-4).
- Infrastructure prerequisites for Kazakhstan deployment (investment, algorithm adaptation, standards) constitute acknowledged unresolved preconditions (LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, p. 90).

---

### PC-6 — Cross-Dataset Transferability
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- No experimental results yet available; claim is pending Experiment 3 execution.
- CONDITIONAL: promotion to MODERATE requires G = F1_APTOS / F1_EyePACS ≥ 0.85 on APTOS 2019 zero-shot transfer.
- Claim fails if G < 0.85 on APTOS 2019 (Invariants VCR-3 applied to H-4).

---

### PC-7 — Explainability (Grad-CAM)
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- No experimental results yet available; claim is pending Experiment 4 execution.
- CONDITIONAL: promotion to MODERATE requires IoU(preprocessing) > IoU(baseline) with statistical significance (e.g., paired test across IDRiD images) for at least 3 of 4 lesion types.
- Results are bounded to EfficientNet-B4 architecture; IoU is an interpretability metric, not clinical localization (NC-14).

---

### PC-8 — Preprocessing Component Hierarchy
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- No experimental results yet available; claim is pending Experiment 2 execution.
- CONDITIONAL: promotion to MODERATE requires an identifiable contribution ranking with consistent ordering across cross-validation folds.
- The hierarchy is bounded to tested architectures and datasets (NC-17); non-additivity of component interactions (CA-8.1) may limit interpretability of the ranking.

---

### PC-9 — Device Domain Shift Robustness
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- No experimental results yet available; claim is pending Experiment 6 execution.
- CONDITIONAL: promotion to MODERATE requires performance variance across camera groups below a defined threshold (to be specified in Experiment 6 protocol).
- Device domain shift results do not constitute device certification (NC-16); camera-specific characteristics beyond preprocessing scope may remain unaddressed (CA-9.1).

---

### PC-10 — External Clinical Performance
**Strength: CONDITIONAL**
**Justification:**
- No experimental results yet available; claim is pending Experiment 5 execution.
- CONDITIONAL: promotion requires PASS_S on **both** IDRiD and Messidor-2 — Δ wF1(X) ≥ MCID_wF1 = 0.050 with CI⁻ > 0 on each.
- Claim fails (REVERSED) if CI⁺ < 0 on either dataset; datasets are not aggregated.
- [v7.0.0] The prior Δ_drop-based promotion condition is withdrawn; Δ_drop is descriptive only and cannot promote or demote this claim.

## VII. NON-CLAIMS (Explicitly Not Argued)

The following propositions are intentionally excluded from the dissertation's argumentation. These are not claims of the dissertation. They are listed here to enforce epistemic boundary compliance.

**NC-1.** The proposed preprocessing pipeline is effective for all fundus image datasets.
*(Forbidden per CFC-2.1; DGL-1)*

**NC-2.** The proposed pipeline outperforms existing commercial DR diagnostic systems (IDx-DR, EyeNuk, DeepMind, etc.) under identical evaluation conditions.
*(Forbidden per CFC-2.2: no controlled experiment against named systems under identical conditions is documented)*

**NC-3.** The system reduces late-stage DR complications by 20–30% in Kazakhstan, or reduces healthcare costs by 15–20%.
*(Forbidden per CFC-2.3; SIR-8; SB-1.6: these are third-party projections cited by LC-2025-Yesmukhamedov-01, p. 88)*

**NC-4.** The system achieves clinical-grade diagnostic accuracy.
*(Forbidden per CFC-2.4: no clinical validation trial is documented in any literature card)*

**NC-5.** The preprocessing pipeline achieves 100% accuracy on DR classification.
*(Forbidden per CFC-2.5; SB-1.2: the 100% accuracy in LC-AlTimemy-2021 is on a different dataset, different taxonomy, and potentially affected by metric formula anomaly)*

**NC-6.** EfficientNetB0 represents the globally optimal or generally superior architecture for DR classification.
*(Forbidden per SIR-7; SB-1.7: alternative architectures were not comparatively evaluated)*

**NC-7.** The laser-tissue interaction mathematical model (Chapter 2, §2.4) constitutes an experimentally or clinically validated model.
*(Forbidden per SB-1.5; SIR-6)*

**NC-8.** The system architecture (Chapter 6) has been prototype-implemented or field-tested in Kazakhstan healthcare settings.
*(Forbidden per SB-4.1; SB-4.3; DGL-4)*

**NC-9.** GDPR/HIPAA compliance has been certified for the proposed system.
*(Forbidden per SB-4.2: compliance framing is a design specification only)*

**NC-10.** CLAHE parameters optimized in this dissertation are portable to other fundus image datasets or imaging devices without independent validation.
*(Forbidden per DGL-5)*

**NC-11.** Results generalize to imaging modalities other than fundus photography (OCT, fluorescein angiography, etc.).
*(Forbidden per SB-1.4)*

**NC-12.** The proposed system performs equivalently across specific demographic subgroups (ethnic, age-stratified, comorbidity-defined populations).
*(Forbidden per DGL-3)*

**NC-13.** LC-SAPAKOVA-2025 and LC-Yesmukhamedov-2025-SELF constitute independent confirmatory evidence of any shared claim.
*(Forbidden per SIR-5: sources share identical experimental data)*

**NC-14.** Grad-CAM activation does not constitute clinical localization of pathology — it is an interpretability tool, not a diagnostic output. Grad-CAM overlays indicate regions of high gradient-weighted activation in the final convolutional layer and do not represent pixel-level diagnostic delineation of lesion boundaries.
*(Forbidden per SB-1.11; Invariants H-5 scope)*

**NC-15.** The dirty data pipeline (External Image Ingestion Protocol) is not validated for arbitrary clinical data sources — validation is bounded to specific Kazakh medical center data processed. Generalization of the ingestion protocol to other clinical data sources requires independent validation.
*(Forbidden per Invariants scope boundaries)*

**NC-16.** Device domain shift results do not constitute device certification or regulatory compliance — they are empirical observations of cross-device performance variability. No claim of device-agnostic deployment readiness is permissible based on Experiment 6 alone.
*(Forbidden per SB-1.8; Invariants H-6 scope)*

**NC-17.** The preprocessing component ablation does not identify a universally optimal preprocessing configuration — the component hierarchy is bounded to the tested architectures (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B3) and datasets (EyePACS). Extension to other architectures or datasets requires independent experimental validation.
*(Forbidden per Invariants Experiment 2 scope)*
