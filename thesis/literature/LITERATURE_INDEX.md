**Candidate:** Yesmukhamedov N.S.
**Generated from:** Literature Cards in /literature/
**Total sources indexed:** 120 active (numbered 01–121; #13 retired as duplicate of #11)
**Version:** 6.1.0 — extends v6.0.0 with the #83–#121 expansion (39 new sources): the FGADR benchmark plus ophthalmology-specific SSL/foundation models, fundus image-degradation & quality, foundational loss/optimisation/regularisation/augmentation methods, architecture-lineage references, transfer-learning & medical-DL surveys, and externally-validated DR/ophthalmology clinical studies. Resolves the §1.2.1 gap and the §2.3.3 / §3.3.2 SSL gaps; fills the missing card files for #46 (Grad-CAM), #47 (EyePACS) and #48 (Messidor).

> **v6.0.0 amendment (navigation sync).** The Section Map Key, Source Index "Maps to" column, and
> Coverage Matrix are re-aligned to the current chapter structure: all seven experiments now live in
> **Chapter 4** (§4.2–§4.8) and Chapter 5 is "Reliability Validation and Comparative Analysis"
> (§5.1 Explainability Results, §5.2 Statistical Validation, §5.3 Comparative Analysis, §5.4 Limitations).
> Section-code remap applied throughout this index: **old §5.1→§4.4, §5.2→§5.1, §5.3→§4.7, §5.4→§5.2,
> §5.5→§5.3, §5.6→§5.4**; the dropped "Robustness to Image Degradation" experiment (old §4.4) is removed.
> Two sections were added per v6.0.0 (ophthalmology-specific self-supervised pretraining): **§2.3.3**
> (theory) and **§3.3.2** (methodology). H-1 is now "Integrated Pipeline Dominance" (composite
> *preprocessing × pretraining* IV); CLAHE is named "dual-constraint clip limit".

### Gaps Identified

**⚠️ GAP (0 external sources) — remaining after the v6.1.0 expansion:**
- §3.1.4 — External Image Ingestion Protocol (methodological contribution by candidate; no external literature expected — by design)

**✅ GAPS RESOLVED in the v6.1.0 expansion (#83–#121):**
- §1.2.1 — Sources of Image Degradation in Clinical Practice — RESOLVED by **#93** (Shen et al. cofe-Net: explicit degradation model of uneven illumination, blur, artifacts).
- §3.3.2 — Ophthalmology-Specific Self-Supervised Pretraining — RESOLVED by **#84 (RETFound)** + **#90 (MAE, the pretraining basis)** + **#85 (MICLe)** + the SSL method corpus **#86–#89, #91** + survey **#92**.
- §2.3.3 — In-Domain Self-Supervised Pretraining for Retinal Imaging — RESOLVED by the same #84–#92 corpus (was ⚡ THIN on #73 only).

**✅ GAPS RESOLVED previously (#54–#82):**
- §2.1.3 — Spatial Filtering and Noise Reduction Methods — RESOLVED by #55 (bilateral filtering) and #56 (non-local means).
- §2.5.3 — ALO and IoU as Quantitative Explainability Metrics — RESOLVED by #63 (Generalized IoU metric/loss) and #64 (PASCAL VOC IoU > 0.5 criterion).

**⚡ THIN (1 source or thin coverage) — after v6.1.0:**
- §2.4.1 — Coupled Thermal-Optical Model of Fundus Tissue Response (#20 🔹SELF only) — still THIN.
- §4.2 — Experiment 1: Integrated Pipeline Dominance (#19, #21, #24 🔹SELF only; the SSL corpus #84–#92 now supports the *pretraining* arm of the composite H-1 IV, but the integrated-pipeline self-comparison remains self-only).
- §4.8 — Experiment 7: Small Data Training (#06, #10 dataset descriptors; #84 RETFound label-efficiency is supportive context) — still THIN.

**⬆️ THIN STATUS UPGRADED in the v6.1.0 expansion:**
- §2.3.3 / §3.3.2 → **well-covered** by #84–#92 (see Gaps Resolved above).
- §2.6 — Image Quality Metrics → adds #93 (cofe-Net) and #94 (Zago RIQA, fundus-specific) to #52, #53.
- §6.1 — System Requirements → adds #119 (Beede et al. socio-technical deployment) to #22.
- §2.2.2 / §2.2.3 — Loss & Regularization → adds the canonical method primaries #96 (Focal Loss, the dissertation's loss), #97, #98, #99, #100, #101, #102, #103, #104.

**⬆️ THIN STATUS UPGRADED in the #54–#82 expansion (retained):**
- §1.3.3 — Explainability Methods → #46, #57, #58, #59, #60, #61, #62. **Well-covered.**
- §2.2.1 — Convolution, Pooling, and Feature Extraction → #08, #65, #66, #67 (AlexNet/ResNet/DenseNet foundations).
- §2.3.1 — Feature Transferability Across Visual Domains → #04, #71, #72, #73.
- §2.5.1 — CAM / Grad-CAM Theory → #46, #57 (CAM), #58 (Grad-CAM++).
- §2.5.2 — Attention Map Interpretation → #46, #57, #58.
- §4.7 — Experiment 6: Device Domain Shift (was dataset-descriptors only) → adds #74, #75, #76 (DG/DA literature) + #78 (image-quality).

Per INVARIANTS SIR-9, every CNN-based or ViT-based DR/retinal-image classification source has been tagged as **P1** (end-to-end CNN paradigm; preprocessing as auxiliary step), **P2-tending** (preprocessing explicitly formalised as model component), or **N/A** (methodology reference, dataset descriptor, clinical/pathophysiology review, mathematical model, system architecture, or survey). Tag rationale:
- **P1** — backbone-centric study in which preprocessing is either unreported, reported as a fixed exogenous step, or varied but treated as a tuning input rather than as a formalised model component. The dominant class in the literature corpus.
- **P1 (canonical representative)** — reserved for Gulshan et al. (2016) per SB-1.12 / SIR-9; see gulshan-2016.md §15 Paradigmatic Role for the methodological-practice grounds.
- **P2-tending (prior self-work toward the integrated pipeline)** — the candidate's prior preprocessing studies (#23, #24) that move toward the formalisation but predate the integrated-preprocessing-CNN paradigm as formally defined in this dissertation. Per CFC-2.7 they must be cited as prior own work and as evolutionary precursors of the pipeline, not as full P2 instantiations.
- **N/A** — the source does not have a paradigmatic position in the P1/P2 dichotomy: dataset descriptors, methodology references (Grad-CAM, SSIM, calibration), pathophysiology reviews, mathematical models, system architectures, surveys.

Per CFC-2.9 and SIR-1, no source has been attributed an explicit "preprocessing is unimportant" claim. P1 tagging is a claim about *observable methodological practice*, not about authorial intent. Per CFC-2.2, no Paradigm tag licenses a head-to-head numerical comparison with the source. Per SB-1.12, the Paradigm column does not redefine the dissertation's operational experimental baseline (configs A/C, OD-3).

**v6.0.0 navigation-sync note (READ FIRST for cross-references).**
This index was re-aligned to the corrected chapter structure. The seven experiments are now all in Chapter 4; Chapter 5 is validation/analysis. Where older notes below cite section numbers, translate per this remap: **old §5.1 (cross-database generalization / Exp 5) → §4.4** (Cross-Dataset Transferability, Exp 3) and **§4.6** (Clinical Degradation, Exp 5); **old §5.2 → §5.1** (Explainability Results); **old §5.3 (device domain shift, Exp 6) → §4.7**; **old §5.4 → §5.2** (Statistical Validation); **old §5.5 → §5.3** (Comparative Analysis); **old §5.6 → §5.4** (Limitations). The old "Robustness to Image Degradation" experiment (old §4.4) is dropped. H-1 is now **"Integrated Pipeline Dominance"** (composite *preprocessing × pretraining-source* IV: ImageNet baseline vs. ophthalmology-specific SSL); CLAHE is named **"dual-constraint clip limit"**; §2.3.3 and §3.3.2 are new SSL sections per the v6.0.0 amendment.

**Existing notes (retained):**

1. Sources #06 and #10 are **duplicate entries** for the same article (Porwal et al., 2018 — IDRiD dataset descriptor). Consider consolidating to a single entry.
2. ~~Sources #11 and #13 duplicate~~ — RESOLVED: duplicate card removed; Source #11 (ting-2017.md) is the canonical entry. #13 is retired and is not used anywhere in this index.
3. Source #18 (González-Díaz et al., 2024) addresses **AMD, not diabetic retinopathy**. Its relevance is peripheral (ViT architecture comparison only).

**Self-publication notes (retained):**

4. Sources #19–#24 are all **co-authored by the dissertation candidate** (🔹SELF flag). All carry **high self-plagiarism risk** — content must be explicitly self-cited and substantially reformulated in the dissertation.
4a. **Numbering in the assembled volume (2026-08-25).** The six 🔹SELF rows are **five distinct works**: #23 + #24 = one article. In the printed reference list they are [1] EEJET (#23/#24), [2] Procedia (#19), [3] NAS RK (#22), [4] KBTU (#21), [5] KazUTB (#20). Every one of the five now carries body citations, as GD-01 requires (see note 4b): [1] ×6, [2] ×4, [3] ×8, [4] ×4, [5] ×3.

4b. **GD-01 / п. 5-1 and п. 6 of the Rules require the dissertation to cite the candidate's own publications.** Before 2026-08-25 only [1] and [3] were cited in the body; [2], [4] and [5] appeared once each inside the Approbation list and nowhere else, and §1.1 described the KazUTB laser model across four paragraphs with no reference at all. Added: §2.1 (lineage → [1, 2, 4]), §3.2 (compound-scaled backbone → [2, 4]), §1.1 (laser model → [5]), and a chapter-to-work map in the Approbation paragraph. The card IDs are not renumbered — they are labels, not bibliography.

5. Sources #23 and #24 are **duplicate entries for the same article** (Sapakova, Yesmukhamedov & Sapakov, 2025 — *Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies*, DOI: 10.15587/1729-4061.2025.335570). Two literature cards were prepared from different analytical perspectives. Consider consolidating to a single entry.
6. Sources #19 (CONF, Procedia CS 2025) and #21 (KBTU, Herald KBTU 2025) report **overlapping experiments** — both evaluate EfficientNetB0 frozen vs. fine-tuned on APTOS 2019 with nearly identical metrics. The dissertation should treat these as a single experimental thread with unified citation.
7. §6.2 (AI Processing Module / PACS and EHR Integration) accommodates the system architecture content from #22.

**Previous sources notes (#25–#32, retained):**

8. Source #25 (Wikipedia — AHE/CLAHE) is **NOT citable** in a doctoral dissertation. It serves only as a conceptual primer. Original sources (Pizer et al., 1987 = #54; Zuiderveld, 1994) should be cited instead. Classified as **Background reference**.
9. Source #26 (Shaout & Han, 2025) is an **arXiv preprint** evaluated by 10-person subjective survey only. Low epistemic weight. Provides reproducible fuzzy+CLAHE pipeline with explicit CLAHE parameters (clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=8×8).
10. Source #27 (Hayati et al., 2023) is the **most directly relevant new external source** — it empirically evaluates CLAHE's impact on 4 CNN architectures for binary DR classification on APTOS 2019. Key nuance: CLAHE degraded ResNet34 by −12.02%, complicating universal preprocessing-dominance claims. Published in Procedia Computer Science (conference proceedings); limited-scope study with accuracy-only metrics.
11. Sources #28 (Brancati et al., 2025) and #29 (Tabari et al., 2024) are **domain mismatches** — FHIR/health informatics papers with no relevance to DR deep learning. Classified as **Peripheral**. Should not be included in the dissertation literature review unless clinical deployment infrastructure is discussed.
12. Source #30 (Chakka, 2023) is published in a **high school journal** with minimal peer review. No numerical metrics reported. Extremely low epistemic weight. Classified as **Limited-scope**.
13. Sources #31 (Kesharwani et al., 2021) and #32 (Kusuhara et al., 2018) **resolve the §1.1.1 GAP** (Pathophysiology and Clinical Grading Systems). However, #31 has significant citation errors and was published in a journal flagged for questionable editorial practices — cite with caution. #32 (Kusuhara et al., 2018, *Diabetes & Metabolism Journal*) is the **higher-quality source** for DR pathophysiology.

**New sources notes (#33–#45):**

14. Sources #33 (Gettinger et al., 2025), #34 (Morya et al., 2024), and #35 (Wang & Lo, 2018) are **pathophysiology/treatment narrative reviews** that collectively **strengthen §1.1.1 coverage** from 2 to 5 sources. All three reinforce neurodegeneration-preceding-microvasculopathy claims. None carry AI benchmarking value. #35 (Wang & Lo) provides the strongest clinical trial linkage (DRCR.net Protocol I).
15. Source #34 (Morya et al., 2024) additionally provides **screening compliance data** (35–55%) and **AI screening mentions** (IDxDR, Remidio Medios) — useful for §1.1.2 and §6.3 framing, though AI discussion is high-level and non-architectural.
16. Source #36 (Nandal, 2024) is an **HL7/FHIR interoperability prototype** study. **Peripheral to core DR imaging research**, but directly relevant to §6.2 (PACS/EHR integration). Resolves previous ⚡ THIN status of §6.2 (was covered only by #22 🔹SELF). However: no DOI reported, published in a non-core journal, moderate epistemic weight.
17. Source #37 (Geetha & Hema, 2026) presents a ViT-BFF-HGS hybrid for joint DR/glaucoma detection. **Architecturally novel** but critically flawed: no dataset names disclosed, no external validation, no AUC/CI/statistical testing. High internal accuracy claim (98.4%) unsupported by standard validation. **Use only as transformer-era architectural reference**, not as evidence of generalization.
18. Source #38 (Khosravi et al., 2025) is the **strongest new external validation study** — multi-country (USA, South Korea, Brazil), multi-source (public + private), 2661 external images, FastViT vs ResNet18. **Not DR-focused** (retinal hemorrhage classification) but demonstrates cross-dataset ViT > CNN advantage. Directly supports §4.4 (cross-dataset transferability) arguments. Caution: severe class imbalance (2346 medical vs 315 trauma) and no CI/statistical tests.
19. Source #39 (Senapati et al., 2024) is a **PRISMA-based systematic review** of DR AI (2016–2023). Provides bibliometric landscape and identifies overfitting, class imbalance, and early-stage detection as key gaps. **Resolves ⚡ THIN status of §1.5** (was covered only by #17). No empirical benchmarking or ViT coverage. Moderate epistemic weight as field-mapping survey.
20. Source #40 (Araf et al., 2024) is the **first systematic review dedicated to cost-sensitive learning in medical data** (173 papers, 2010–2022). Reveals that only 2 of 173 studies were validation research. Strengthens §2.2.2 (loss functions for imbalanced data) and partially addresses §3.4 (evaluation frameworks). No architecture-level or DR-specific benchmarking.
21. Source #41 (Sharma et al., 2025) proposes ViT-CapsNet on EyePACS (30,262 images). **Critical inconsistency**: reported AUC values per class (0.44–0.56) are fundamentally incompatible with claimed 94% accuracy. No external validation, no hyperparameter transparency, no statistical testing. **Cite with extreme caution** — epistemic weight is low due to internal metric inconsistency.
22. Source #42 (Arora et al., 2024) applies EfficientNetB0 to Kaggle DR with undersampling (35,108 → 3,704 images). Internal accuracy 0.8653; max training accuracy 97.11% suggests **significant overfitting** (11-point gap). No AUC, no class-wise metrics, no external validation. CI bounds reported as identical values (likely artifact). Limited epistemic weight.
23. Source #43 (Ryu et al., 2021) is an **OCTA-based DR classification study** with external validation — ResNet101 on OCTA scans, AUC 0.960–0.976 internal, 0.938–0.962 external. **Not fundus-based**, but demonstrates temporal external validation methodology and CNN > handcrafted feature advantage. Useful as modality-shift reference for §1.3.1 and §1.4.
24. Source #44 (Zhang et al., 2022) is a **high-quality multicentre external validation study** published in BMJ Open. Ensemble CNN (Inception-V3/Xception/Inception-ResNet-V2) on 83,465 images from 4 centres. AUROC 0.9931 referable DR, Cohen's κ 0.86–0.93 vs experts. **Strongest new evidence for §4.4 (transferability) and §5.3 (comparative analysis)**. Limitation: China-only, no public dataset benchmarking, preprocessing not reported.
25. Source #45 (Ruamviboonsuk et al., 2022) is the **highest-impact new source** — prospective clinical validation of DL screening in Thailand's national programme, published in *The Lancet Digital Health*. Sens 91.4% VTDR, outperformed specialists (p=0.024), 9 sites, 7,651 patients. **Gold standard for §6.3 clinical deployment evidence**. Limitation: no architecture transparency, no preprocessing details, single-country.

**Impact of new sources on coverage gaps:**

26. §1.1.1 (Pathophysiology) upgraded from **2 sources to 5 sources** (#31, #32, #33, #34, #35). **Well-covered**.
27. §1.1.2 (Screening Requirements) upgraded from **3 to 4 sources** (added #34 via screening compliance data).
28. §1.4 (Critical Analysis of DR Systems) upgraded from **8 to 12 sources** (added #39, #43, #44, #45). **Very well-covered**.
29. §1.5 (Formulation of Research Problem) upgraded from **⚡ THIN (1 source) to 2 sources** (#17, #39). No longer critically thin.
30. §2.2.2 (Loss Functions / Imbalanced Data) upgraded from **3 to 6 sources** (added #39, #40, #42).
31. §3.4 (Evaluation Framework) upgraded from **⚡ THIN (1 🔹SELF) to 2 sources** (added #40). Now has external support.
32. §4.4 (Cross-Dataset Transferability, Exp 3) carries the external-validation corpus formerly indexed under old §5.1 — #02, #04, #05, #07, #11, #12, #16, #17, #38, #44, #48. **Well-covered.**
33. §5.3 (Comparative Analysis) upgraded from **9 to 11 sources** (added #44, #45 to the prior comparative-analysis corpus).
34. §6.2 (PACS/EHR Integration) upgraded from **⚡ THIN (1 🔹SELF) to 2 sources** (added #36). Now has external support.
35. §6.3 (Clinical Workflow) upgraded from **5 to 7 sources** (added #34, #44, #45). **Very well-covered**.
36. **Remaining true gaps**: §1.2.1, §3.1.4 (by design), and the new §3.3.2 (SSL). §2.1.3 was resolved by #55/#56.
37. **⚠️ Self-only coverage warning:** Sections §2.4.1, §4.2, §6.1 remain covered **only by self-publications**. External supporting literature is strongly recommended for examiner robustness.
38. **⚠️ Metric inconsistency flag**: Source #41 (Sharma et al., 2025) reports class-level AUC values (0.44–0.56) incompatible with 94% accuracy. Do NOT cite AUC values without explicit disclaimers.

**Notes on the explainability / device-shift expansion (#46–#82):**

39. Sources #46–#53 support the expanded experimental design (explainability, device domain shift, calibration, image-quality metrics). Sources #46 (Selvaraju, Grad-CAM), #47 (EyePACS descriptor), #48 (Messidor descriptor), #52 (Guo, calibration), and #53 (Wang, SSIM) are canonical references. Sources #49 (RFMiD, Pachade et al. 2021) and #50 (DDR, Li et al. 2019) are dataset descriptors with identifiable papers — **cards now written**. Source #51 (ODIR-5K) is **resolved**: it has no peer-reviewed descriptor and is cited as the ODIR-2019 challenge **electronic resource** — **card now written**.
40. §2.5 (Explainability in Deep Learning for Medical Imaging) requires Grad-CAM formalization. Source #46 (Selvaraju et al., 2017) is the foundational reference; #57 (CAM) and #58 (Grad-CAM++) complete the lineage.
41. §1.2.3 (Device-Specific Variability in Fundus Imaging) and §4.7 (Experiment 6: Device Domain Shift). Sources #49, #50, #51 provide dataset descriptors with camera model information; #74, #75, #76 supply the domain-shift theory.
42. **Section numbering authority.** The Section Map Key above is authoritative and reflects the corrected TABLE_OF_CONTENTS (EN/KZ) under INVARIANTS v6.0.0. Historical "Maps to" entries in individual literature cards still using the v2.1/v3.0 numbering must be remapped per the v6.0.0 navigation-sync note during the next literature-card pass.

**New sources notes (#54–#82) — foundational method, architecture, explainability, and domain-shift corpus:**

43. Sources #54–#82 are **foundational / methodological references** grounding the dissertation's preprocessing, architecture, transfer-learning, explainability, and domain-shift chapters in their canonical primary literature. Most are **N/A** under the Paradigm rule (architecture papers, methodology references, surveys, dataset/benchmark descriptors) because they are not CNN/ViT-based **DR/retinal** classification studies. Only #77 (Abràmoff — autonomous DR detection) and #78 (Fu — EyeQ retinal image-quality classification) are retinal-image CNN studies and are tagged **P1**.
44. **CLAHE provenance resolved.** Source #54 (Pizer et al., 1987) introduces *clipped* adaptive histogram equalization — the methodological origin of CLAHE. It is the **citable primary source** that replaces the non-citable Wikipedia entry (#25) flagged in note 8. The dissertation should cite #54 (and Zuiderveld, 1994, if acquired) for CLAHE rather than #25 in §2.1.1–§2.1.2.
45. **§2.1.3 GAP resolved.** Sources #55 (Tomasi & Manduchi — bilateral filtering) and #56 (Buades et al. — non-local means) supply the previously-missing spatial-filtering / noise-reduction literature. Both are method papers with qualitative (not benchmark) evaluation; cite as algorithmic foundations, not as evidence of DR classification gains.
46. **Explainability corpus.** Source #57 (Zhou et al., 2016 — CAM) and #58 (Chattopadhyay et al., 2018 — Grad-CAM++); together with #46 (Selvaraju — Grad-CAM) they ground §2.5.1–§2.5.2 and Exp 4 (§4.5). Sources #59 (Tjoa & Guan), #60 (Samek et al. — LRP), #61 (Lundberg & Lee — SHAP), and #62 (Ribeiro et al. — LIME) broaden §1.3.3/§2.5. **Caution:** #61 (SHAP) and #62 (LIME) are feature-attribution methods not used as the dissertation's primary lesion-localization tool — cite as XAI background, not as the operational explainability metric.
47. **§2.5.3 grounding.** Source #63 (Rezatofighi et al. — Generalized IoU) and #64 (Everingham et al. — PASCAL VOC, defining AP and the IoU > 0.5 criterion) provide the formal IoU grounding for the ALO/IoU overlap evaluation in Exp 4 (§4.5). Both are object-detection references; the dissertation must frame IoU as an *overlap metric borrowed for lesion-localization evaluation*, not as a detection benchmark.
48. **CNN backbone provenance.** Sources #65 (AlexNet), #66 (ResNet), #67 (DenseNet), #68 (EfficientNet), #69 (EfficientNetV2) and #70 (ViT) are the canonical architecture papers. **#66 (ResNet-50)** and **#68 (EfficientNet-B3)** are the dissertation's two operational backbones (Exp 1, configs A–D) and should be cited at first mention in §3.2. #70 (ViT) and #69 (EfficientNetV2) support the CNN-vs-ViT discussion (§1.3.1).
49. **Transfer-learning / SSL theory.** Sources #71 (Yosinski et al.), #72 (Kornblith et al.), and #73 (Cheplygina et al. — SSL/MIL/TL medical survey) ground §2.3.1–§2.3.2. **#73 additionally anchors the new §2.3.3 / §3.3.2 (in-domain self-supervised pretraining)** per the v6.0.0 amendment, but is a general survey — dedicated DINO/BYOL/SimCLR/MoCo and ophthalmology-SSL primary sources still need to be acquired (see §3.3.2 GAP).
50. **Domain-shift literature.** Sources #74 (Zhou et al. — DG survey), #75 (Wang & Deng — DA survey), and #76 (Ganin et al. — DANN) supply the conceptual and methodological grounding for §1.2.3 and Exp 6 (§4.7 device domain shift), previously covered by dataset descriptors only. These are general-purpose (non-retinal) references; cite for problem framing, not as retinal-domain-shift evidence.
51. Source #77 (Abràmoff et al., 2018 — IDx-DR pivotal trial) is a **high-impact prospective clinical-validation precedent** (FDA-authorized autonomous DR system). Strongest new support for §1.4 and §6.3 clinical-deployment arguments. **Limitation:** no preprocessing ablation and no public-benchmark comparison — must not be cited as evidence for the integrated-pipeline-dominance hypothesis.
52. Source #78 (Fu et al., 2020 — EyeQ) re-annotates **28,792 EyePACS images** into a 3-level retinal image-quality dataset and shows downstream DR-detection performance degrades with image quality. Supports §1.2.2 (image quality → performance) and §4.7 (multi-camera EyePACS acquisition). EyePACS-derived single-source; no external validation.
53. **Off-topic / domain-mismatch cards (#79–#82).** Sources #79 (encrypted cloud search), #80 (Hermite-function mathematics), #81 (muon-capture nuclear physics), and #82 (graphene quantum-Hall physics) are **outside the medical-imaging / DR domain** and carry negligible relevance. They are indexed for completeness and registered in the Peripheral Sources Registry below. They should **not** appear in the dissertation literature review.
54. **Alternate / supplementary cards for already-indexed sources (no new number assigned).** Two newly-supplied cards are second analytical cards for sources already in this index and do **not** receive new source numbers:
    - `gulshan-2016-supplementary-validation.md` → maps to **#12** (Gulshan et al., 2016). Analyses the JAMA supplementary appendix (scale-normalisation to 299 px, FOV-mask exclusion) and reinforces #12's §1.2.2/§3.1 preprocessing detail; cite under #12.
    - `voets-2019-reproduction-study.md` → maps to **#17** (Voets et al., 2019). Details the public-data reproduction (EyePACS AUC 0.951, Messidor-2 0.853) and reproducibility recommendations; cite under #17.
    Both files are in `external/` for archival completeness but are consolidated to their canonical entries (analogous to the #06/#10 and #23/#24 duplicate-card handling).

> **✅ Dataset-descriptor cards completed (2026-06-16):** #49 (Pachade — RFMiD `pachade-2021-rfmid.md`), #50 (Li — DDR `li-2019-ddr.md`), and #51 (ODIR-2019 / ODIR-5K `odir-2019-dataset.md`) now have card files. #51's "TO BE IDENTIFIED" flag is **resolved**: ODIR-5K has no peer-reviewed descriptor and is carded/cited as the ODIR-2019 challenge **electronic resource**. Cards were compiled from open-access records (RFMiD abstract + dataset docs; DDR abstract + official repository, full Elsevier text pending; ODIR challenge site) — each carries a Source-access note and `[NOT REPORTED]`/`[VERIFY]` flags where the full text was not accessed. Upgrade #50 from the full PDF when available.
