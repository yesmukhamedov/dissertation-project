## II. GLOBAL SOURCE ANALYSIS

### II.1. Central Thesis

The central thesis, as explicitly stated by the authors, is formulated in the aim of the study: "The aim of the study is the development of an approach that combines advanced image enhancement techniques with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automated diabetic retinopathy diagnosis. The emphasis is on integrating methods that have not been previously combined, focusing on improving robustness and accuracy under variable image quality and limited computational resources." (p. 81)

A more concise formulation appears in the abstract: "The core problem addressed is the suboptimal performance of baseline CNNs in identifying DR stages from medical imagery." The thesis is that integrating advanced preprocessing techniques (resizing, normalization, CLAHE, data augmentation) with CNN architecture yields significantly improved classification performance compared to a baseline CNN without such preprocessing. (p. 79)

### II.2. Research Problem Addressed

The specific problem addressed is stated as follows: "the limited generalization ability of neural networks under variable image quality, the absence of a unified framework integrating image enhancement and classification in an optimized, resource-efficient manner, and the lack of standardized, annotated datasets for benchmarking." (p. 81)

The problem is framed as both **methodological** (absence of a unified preprocessing-classification framework) and **empirical** (demonstrating that preprocessing integration improves CNN accuracy under constrained conditions). The authors explicitly frame the issue as the "suboptimal performance of baseline CNNs in identifying DR stages from medical imagery" (p. 79), attributing this to the dependence of model accuracy on image quality: "In real clinical scenarios, retinal images often suffer from poor resolution, uneven illumination, and various types of noise. These factors significantly impair the generalizability of neural network models." (p. 79)

### II.3. Methodology

**Theoretical framework:** The theoretical framework is not formally named or cited as a unified theory. It is implicitly grounded in convolutional neural network theory (feature extraction via convolution and pooling, classification via fully connected layers) and image processing theory (contrast enhancement, spatial normalization). The authors reference the general CNN architecture (input → convolution → pooling → fully connected → output) as the structural basis (p. 83, Fig. 3).

**Methods used:**

- **Image preprocessing:**
  - Resizing: all images resized to 256 × 256 pixels for the baseline model and 512 × 512 pixels using cubic interpolation for the enhanced model (pp. 81, 83)
  - Normalization: pixel values normalized to [0, 1] range (p. 82)
  - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization): applied using OpenCV with clip limit of 2.0 and grid size of 8 × 8 (p. 83)
  - Data augmentation: horizontal and vertical flips, random rotations (±15°), zoom (±10%), and brightness variation (p. 83)
  - Image super-resolution: cubic interpolation via OpenCV to upscale images to 512 × 512 pixels (p. 83)

- **CNN architectures:**
  - *Baseline model:* Two convolutional blocks (32 filters, then 64 filters), both using 3 × 3 kernels and ReLU activation, followed by max-pooling (2 × 2); fully connected layer with 128 neurons (ReLU); output layer with single neuron and sigmoid activation for binary classification; optimized with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss; input size 256 × 256; batch size 32; 30 epochs (p. 83)
  - *Enhanced model:* Four convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128, 256), each with ReLU activation and max-pooling; batch normalization layers; dropout layers (rate = 0.4) after dense layers; two dense layers followed by softmax output layer (5-class); compiled with Adam optimizer (learning rate = 0.0001) and categorical cross-entropy loss; batch size 32; early stopping applied; convergence within 35–40 epochs (p. 83)

- **Implementation:** Both models built using Keras with TensorFlow backend; CLAHE applied using OpenCV (p. 83)

**Data sources:**

- APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset: 3,662 labeled training samples and 1,928 unlabeled test samples; five DR stages (0 = no DR, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = proliferative DR) (p. 81)
- Supplementary retinal images from local medical centers, manually labeled by certified ophthalmologists; not publicly available due to privacy agreements (pp. 81, 83)
- The enhanced model was trained on a dataset of 25,000 labeled retinal images, split 80% training / 10% validation / 10% testing (p. 83)
- The authors note the dataset is "not publicly available due to ethical considerations" (p. 79) and "privacy agreements" (p. 83)

**Analytical approach:**

- Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix analysis (p. 83)
- Comparison between baseline and enhanced models across training/validation accuracy and loss over 10 epochs (Table 2, p. 86)
- ROC curve analysis with AUC computation (Fig. 8, p. 85)
- Classification reports with per-class precision, recall, and F1-score (Figs. 4–5, p. 84)

### II.4. Conceptual Contributions

The source does not introduce new technical terms or formal theoretical frameworks. It uses established concepts (CLAHE, CNN, data augmentation, ROC-AUC, etc.) without modification.

The principal conceptual contribution is the articulation of a *synergy between preprocessing and CNN architecture*: "A distinctive feature of the results lies in the synergy between preprocessing and CNN architecture, which enabled significantly improved classification performance even under hardware constraints." (p. 79) This "synergy" is not formally defined but is used to describe the combined effect of the preprocessing pipeline and CNN classification as exceeding the sum of their individual contributions.

The authors also frame the concept of a *modular pipeline*: "A promising approach to address current limitations in automated DR diagnosis is the development of modular pipelines that combine lightweight image enhancement with transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs." (p. 81) However, transfer learning is not implemented in this study; it is referenced as a future direction.

### II.5. Empirical Contributions

**Data generated/analyzed:**

- The authors trained and evaluated two CNN models on retinal fundus image datasets as described above.

**Principal quantitative findings:**

- Image enhancement techniques (resizing and augmentation) improved validation accuracy from 71% to 86% (p. 83)
- Enhanced model achieved 94.5% training accuracy and 91.3% validation accuracy, converging within 35–40 epochs (p. 84)
- With preprocessing (CV2/CLAHE), accuracy reached 91% (precision 0.90/0.93, recall 0.93/0.90, F1-score 0.91/0.91 for classes 0 and 1 respectively) vs. 88% without preprocessing (precision 0.91/0.85, recall 0.83/0.92, F1-scores 0.87/0.89) (p. 84)
- ROC-AUC = 0.9638 (p. 84)
- Enhanced model by Epoch 9: validation accuracy 93.41%, validation loss 0.1833 vs. original model validation accuracy 91.71%, validation loss 0.2288 (Table 2, p. 86)
- Original model loss started at ~0.67 and stabilized around 0.27–0.30; enhanced model loss started at ~0.23 and stabilized around 0.18–0.20 (p. 84)
- Processing time: 1s 108ms/step (with preprocessing) vs. 8s 986ms/step (without preprocessing) (p. 84)
- Conclusion reports: precision (0.82), recall (0.85), F1-score (0.83); validation loss reduced from 0.89 to 0.45 (p. 87)

**Comparisons made:**

- Baseline CNN (no preprocessing, 256 × 256) vs. Enhanced CNN (preprocessing pipeline, 512 × 512): the enhanced model consistently outperformed across all epochs (Table 2, p. 86)
- With vs. without CV2 preprocessing (Figs. 4–5, p. 84)

### II.6. Limitations Acknowledged by the Author

1. "Dataset-specific training limits the model's generalization. The model was trained and validated on a specific dataset, which may not fully represent the diversity of retinal images encountered in practice." (p. 86)
2. "Hardware constraints prevented longer training durations. Due to overheating during extended training, the number of epochs was limited, potentially restricting the full learning potential of the model." (p. 86)
3. "Controlled imaging conditions in the dataset may differ from varied real-world scenarios, impacting model adaptability to noise, occlusions, or varying illumination levels." (p. 86)
4. "The model's interpretability could be further improved through explainability tools like Grad-CAM or SHAP to enhance clinical trust." (p. 86)
5. "The system currently functions as a black box without incorporating contextual patient data (e.g., medical history), which might limit diagnostic richness." (pp. 86–87)
6. "The model was trained primarily on high-quality images from a private dataset and APTOS 2019, which does not fully capture the variability of retinal images in real clinical practice." (p. 86)

### II.7. Implicit Assumptions

1. **The APTOS 2019 classification scheme (5-class) is clinically valid and sufficient for DR staging.** Textual basis: The authors adopt the APTOS labeling without discussing its clinical validity or comparing it to alternative grading systems (e.g., ETDRS). The five-stage scheme is used as ground truth throughout (p. 81).

2. **Cubic interpolation for upscaling does not introduce diagnostically relevant artifacts.** Textual basis: The authors state cubic interpolation was "chosen for its ability to preserve spatial details" (p. 83) but present no evidence or analysis to verify that upscaling from original resolution to 512 × 512 does not introduce misleading features.

3. **Binary classification performance (with/without preprocessing comparison in Figs. 4–5) is representative of the model's multiclass capability.** Textual basis: The confusion matrix and classification report in Figs. 4–5 show binary classification (classes 0 and 1, p. 84), while the enhanced model is described as a 5-class softmax classifier (p. 83). The relationship between the binary and multiclass evaluations is not explicitly addressed.

4. **The supplementary clinical dataset from local medical centers is compatible with APTOS in terms of image characteristics.** Textual basis: The authors state images were "manually labeled by certified ophthalmologists to ensure consistency with the APTOS classification scheme" (p. 81), but no analysis of distributional similarity between the two sources is provided.

## IV. RELATIONAL POSITIONING

- **Supports which dissertation claims:**
  1. *Preprocessing quality determines CNN diagnostic performance:* Directly supported by the 71% → 86% accuracy improvement from preprocessing alone (p. 83) and the 88% → 91% improvement of the enhanced over baseline model (p. 79).
  2. *A unified preprocessing pipeline integrated with CNN improves accuracy and generalization:* Supported by the complete pipeline specification and comparative evaluation across epochs (Table 2, p. 86) and ROC-AUC of 0.9638 (p. 84).
  3. *The approach is suitable for resource-limited environments:* Partially supported by the demonstration that improved results were achieved "even under hardware constraints" (p. 79), though no formal deployment testing is reported.

- **Contradicts which claims:** No direct contradictions identified. However, the source's conclusion section reports precision (0.82), recall (0.85), and F1-score (0.83) (p. 87), which are lower than the values reported in the main results section (precision 0.90/0.93, recall 0.93/0.90, F1-score 0.91) (p. 84). This internal inconsistency within the source does not contradict the dissertation claims but requires careful handling when citing specific metric values.

- **Extends which conceptual axis:** Extends the methodological axis of preprocessing-CNN integration for medical image classification by providing a complete, specified, and evaluated pipeline with documented CLAHE parameters, augmentation strategies, and CNN architectural details.

- **Overlaps with which other sources:** Based on the source's own reference list, significant methodological overlap exists with:
  - [14] Deshpande (2023): CLAHE combined with GANs for DR classification
  - [17] Bhoopal et al. (2024): ResNet50 with CLAHE-GAN for DR detection

   - The experimental results and evaluation (pp. 83–86, Table 2) overlap with dissertation Chapter 4.
   - The literature review (pp. 79–81) overlaps with dissertation Chapter 1.

2. **Required textual and structural modifications:**
   - All methodological descriptions must be substantially expanded in the dissertation with additional mathematical formalization, implementation details, and justification not present in the article.
   - Results must be presented in the dissertation with extended analysis, additional experiments (e.g., ablation studies, cross-database validation on STARE), and comparisons with additional architectures (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50) that go beyond the article's scope.
   - The literature review must be comprehensively expanded with more sources and deeper analysis.
