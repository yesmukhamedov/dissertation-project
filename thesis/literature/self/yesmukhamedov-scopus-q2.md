## II. GLOBAL SOURCE ANALYSIS

### 1. Central Thesis

The authors propose that a fully automated retinal disease identification system combining an upgraded Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) filter with a fine-tuned pre-trained RESNET50 network can achieve high-accuracy multi-class retinal disease classification while reducing human interaction. The authors explicitly state: "a novel design of an automated retinal diseases detection model to identify a variety of eye illnesses has been proposed. The proposed model simplified the conventional model and introduced a series of pre-processing procedures that allow high accuracy rate in disease identification" (Section 1, p. 4). Their central contribution is the integration of an upgraded CLAHE filter (with a controllable global threshold value) into a transfer learning pipeline to achieve 100% classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity on a five-class retinal disease task.

### 2. Research Problem Addressed

The authors identify the following specific problems:

- Manual diagnosis of retinal diseases by ophthalmologists is "time-consuming, even for skillful ophthalmologists" (Section 1, p. 1), and "the global increment in the number of patients with eye problem might exacerbate the situation in delayed disease detection" (Section 1, p. 1).
- The diagnosis process is "prone to errors when huge dataset is involved" (Abstract, p. 1).
- Conventional CLAHE has a fixed clipping value that may cause "excessive contrast enhancement that may result in processed image with odd appearance and undesired artifacts" (Section 2.2.1, p. 5) and "a poor manifestation in vanishing regions, typically the tiny veins" (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
- The majority of fundus image pixels are black pixels "which might experience excessive enhancement effect that could distort the image overall visibility" (Section 1, p. 2).
- Common CNN requires "substantial amount of training set which is less feasible in training labeled medical images due to its high demand from experts in annotations and limited samples of data" (Section 1, p. 3).

### 3. Methodology

**Theoretical framework:**

- CLAHE theory as established in prior work [21, 30], with the authors' modification adding a global threshold parameter.
- Transfer learning theory: reusing pre-trained neural networks from other domains (specifically ImageNet) and fine-tuning for medical image classification [12, 26, 27, 28].
- RESNET50 architecture as the base pre-trained network, previously trained on ImageNet [33].
- Evaluation metrics based on confusion matrix parameters (TP, TN, FP, FN) as defined in [35].

**Methods used:**

1. *Upgraded CLAHE filter:* Conventional CLAHE clipping limit defined as: CLIP LIMIT = ⌈L/T⌉ + β · (φ − ⌈L/T⌉) (Eq. 1), where T = global threshold, φ = pixels population in each block, β = clip factor, L = gray scale. The proposed upgraded CLAHE uses: CLIP LIMIT = T/80 (Eq. 2). The modification adds a controllable global threshold value to the fixed contrast point (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
2. *Intensity normalization:* Conducted to "increase wider intensity distribution within a proper range" (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
3. *Light ring correction:* Operated in "LAB" color space, replacing the distorted outer border region with original dark background, then converting back to RGB (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
4. *Data augmentation:* Rotation of dataset images by 30 degrees for eleven times (30° to 330°), expanding dataset from 152 to 1800 images (Section 2.2.2, p. 6).
5. *Single CNN model:* 4 convolution layers, 3×3 kernel, stride 1, one pixel-padding, max-pooling 2×2 with stride 2, softmax activation producing 1×6 vector (normal/abnormal) then 1×2 vector for disease class pairs (Section 2.3, pp. 6–7). Used as a quality validator for enhanced images.
6. *Transfer learning with RESNET50:* Input size 224×224×3. Fine-tuned from ImageNet pre-training. New fully connected layer specified for five-class identification (Section 2.4, pp. 7–8). Training parameters: 100 epochs, learning rate 0.0003, elapsed time 262 min (Table 2, p. 11).

**Data sources:**

- STARE (Structured Analysis of the Retina) web-database [29]. The database provides 400 raw fundoscopic images covering 13 diseases and normal cases (Section 2.1.1, p. 5). The study used 157 images (Abstract, p. 1) / 152 images (Section 1, p. 4) from five classes: BDR, CRVO, CNV, PDR, and Normal.
- Inclusion criterion: "Only the pictures that had strong agreement marks annotated by the ophthalmologists were obtained from the image store" (Section 2.1, p. 4).
- Exclusion criterion: "The fundus images with severe artifacts distortions were not included in this study" (Section 2.1, p. 4).

**Analytical approach:**

- Confusion matrix analysis (Fig. 8, p. 10).
- Sensitivity: Sen = TP / (TP + TN) (Eq. 3, p. 9) — *Note: this formula as printed in the source differs from the standard sensitivity formula TP/(TP+FN)*.
- Specificity: Spe = TN / (TN + FP) (Eq. 4, p. 9).
- Accuracy: ACC = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) (Eq. 5, p. 9).
- Comparison with state-of-the-art: VGG19-based method [31] (Table 4, p. 11) and feature extraction methods [18] (Table 5, p. 12).

### 4. Conceptual Contributions

**Key concepts introduced:**

- *Upgraded CLAHE with global threshold T/80:* A modification to the conventional CLAHE filter replacing the fixed clipping value with a controllable threshold calculated as T/80, where T is the global threshold. This allows adaptive histogram improvement "according to the pre-defined global threshold value" (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
- *Single CNN as image quality validator:* The proposed single CNN network was designed to "examine the quality of the enhanced fundus images before entering the following classification stage" (Section 2.3, p. 7), serving as a preprocessing quality meter.
- *Two-stage classification pipeline:* First stage uses single CNN for binary classification (normal/abnormal), second stage uses transferred RESNET50 for multi-class disease identification.

**Definitions provided by the author:**

- Conventional CLAHE clipping limit (Eq. 1): CLIP LIMIT = ⌈L/T⌉ + β · (φ − ⌈L/T⌉), where T = global threshold, φ = pixels population in each block, β = clip factor, L = gray scale (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
- Upgraded CLAHE clipping limit (Eq. 2): CLIP LIMIT = T/80 (Section 2.2.1, p. 5).
- Sensitivity (Eq. 3): Sen = TP / (TP + TN) (p. 9).
- Specificity (Eq. 4): Spe = TN / (TN + FP) (p. 9).
- Accuracy (Eq. 5): ACC = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) (p. 9).

### 5. Empirical Contributions

**Data:**

- Original dataset: 152/157 images from STARE, 5 classes (BDR, CRVO, CNV, PDR, Normal).
- After augmentation: 1800 images total (Section 3/Table 3, p. 11).
- Class balancing: Adjusted to smallest class size of 186 images per class (Section 3, p. 9).
- Training set: 186 images per class × 5 = 930 total; described as 650 images for training and 280 for validation (p. 8). Table 3 shows 186 training + 56 validation per class (p. 11).
- Split: 70% training, 30% test (p. 8).

**Findings:**

- Single CNN model (pairwise classification): 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity for all five binary classification pairs (Table 1, p. 9).
- Transferred RESNET50 (multi-class): 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity (Abstract, p. 1; Section 3, p. 9).
- Confusion matrix shows zero misclassified images across all five classes (Fig. 8, p. 10).
- Training parameters: 100 epochs, learning rate 0.0003, training time 262 min, validation frequency 65 iterations (Table 2, p. 11).
- Optimal CLAHE parameter: T/80 achieved best image enhancement effect according to validation accuracy test (Section 4.1, p. 10).

**Measurable results — comparison with state-of-the-art:**

| Resnet_101 [18] | 81.6% |
| DesNet_121 [18] | 85.5% |
| SetNet_101 [18] | 83.21% |
| WP_CNN_101 [18] | 90.84% |
| Proposed model | 96.7% |

### 6. Limitations Acknowledged by the Author

- "The proposed model had a drawback that its classification only covered five retina classes" (Section 5, p. 12).
- "Further investigation is required to evaluate the model in detecting more disease cases" (Section 5, p. 12).

### 7. Implicit Assumptions

- The rotation-based augmentation (30° increments) adequately represents real-world image variance for retinal fundus images. [Inferable from: Section 2.2.2, p. 6 — no justification provided for why rotation alone suffices as an augmentation strategy.]
- The STARE dataset, with 152–157 images from five classes, is representative enough to validate a generalizable retinal disease detection system. [Inferable from: Section 2.1, p. 4 — no discussion of dataset representativeness or demographic diversity.]
- The reported 100% accuracy on all metrics is indicative of genuine generalization rather than overfitting to a small, augmented dataset. [Inferable from: Section 3, p. 9 — despite acknowledging overfitting as "the main drawback of multi-class classification model" in Section 2.3, p. 7, no explicit overfitting analysis is provided for the final transferred model.]
- The upgraded CLAHE parameter T/80 is universally optimal for retinal fundus image enhancement. [Inferable from: Section 4.1, p. 10 — optimality was determined by validation accuracy on a single dataset.]

## IV. RELATIONAL POSITIONING

**Supports which dissertation claims:**

1. *"The diagnostic effectiveness of CNN models for automated DR classification depends more on the quality of input images than on architectural complexity alone."* — Strongly supported. The source explicitly uses a single CNN as a quality validator for preprocessing output (Section 2.3, p. 7) and attributes classification success to the upgraded CLAHE preprocessing step. The statement "the suggested model can contribute better feature detection than classification accuracy" (p. 4) directly aligns with the preprocessing dominance hypothesis.

2. *"Integration of preprocessing methods with CNN models as a unified system significantly improves diagnostic accuracy."* — Supported. The source presents a unified pipeline (upgraded CLAHE → normalization → augmentation → transfer learning RESNET50) and achieves 100% classification performance.

3. *"The proposed approach achieves high diagnostic results under limited computational resources without requiring complex architectures."* — Supported. The source achieves 100% accuracy using transfer learning on a small dataset (152 original images) with fewer augmented images (960) than the comparator study [31] (2484).

4. *"The proposed method forms a reproducible pipeline for automated diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy."* — Partially supported. The source presents a clear pipeline architecture (Figs. 2, 3, 6) with defined parameters. However, the source addresses general retinal diseases (BDR, CRVO, CNV, PDR), not specifically diabetic retinopathy grading as in the dissertation's APTOS 2019 framework.

**Contradicts which claims (if any):**

- The source reports 100% accuracy/sensitivity/specificity on a very small dataset (157 images from STARE, augmented to 960 balanced images). The dissertation uses APTOS 2019 (3662 images, 5 DR severity classes) and reports more realistic metrics (86% accuracy, F1 ≈ 0.91). The perfect scores raise questions about generalizability and may reflect overfitting to a small, homogeneous dataset rather than genuine model superiority. This difference limits direct comparability of performance claims.
- The source's sensitivity formula (Eq. 3: Sen = TP/(TP+TN), p. 9) appears to differ from the standard formula (TP/(TP+FN)), which may indicate an error in the published text. The dissertation should note this discrepancy when citing evaluation methodology.
- The source uses a different classification task (5 disease types) versus the dissertation (5 DR severity grades 0–4), which are fundamentally different clinical problems.

**Extends which conceptual axis:**

- *CLAHE modification theory:* The source extends CLAHE theory by introducing a controllable threshold parameter (T/80), providing a mathematical formulation (Eq. 2) that the dissertation can reference when discussing its own CLAHE parameterization approach.
- *Transfer learning for small medical datasets:* The source demonstrates transfer learning with RESNET50 on a very small dataset, providing precedent for the dissertation's use of transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 on APTOS 2019.
- *Preprocessing as quality assurance:* The concept of using a simple CNN to validate preprocessing quality before the main classification stage is a novel methodological contribution relevant to the dissertation's preprocessing dominance hypothesis.

**Overlaps with which other sources (if known):**

- [31] Karthikeyan et al. (2019): VGG19 + STARE dataset study, achieving 95.6% classification accuracy — directly compared in Table 4.
- [18] Hong et al. (2018): Deep CNN for AMD detection using feature extraction on STARE — compared in Table 5.
- [27] X. Li et al. (2017): Transfer learning with Alex-Net, VGG variants for diabetic retinopathy — cited as methodological precedent.
- [26] De et al.: Transfer learning with VGG16 for OCTA classification — cited as related work.

## V. REUSABILITY CONTROL

**What can be reused in dissertation drafting:**

- The mathematical formulation of conventional CLAHE (Eq. 1) and upgraded CLAHE (Eq. 2) can be cited as prior art in Chapter 2 (Section 2.1.2) when establishing the theoretical foundations of CLAHE modification.
- The performance comparison data (Tables 4 and 5) can be referenced in Chapter 5 (Section 5.3) when benchmarking against existing methods on the STARE dataset.
- The concept of using a single CNN as a preprocessing quality validator can be referenced as methodological precedent in Chapter 3.
- The augmentation strategy (rotation-based) can be cited in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1.3) as a comparison point to the dissertation's augmentation approach.
- The pipeline architecture description (Figs. 2, 3, 6) can be referenced in Chapter 6 as a precedent for automated DR screening system design.

**What must be reformulated:**

- The CLAHE parameterization differs: the source uses T/80 while the dissertation must define and justify its own CLAHE parameters. Direct adoption of T/80 is not appropriate without independent validation on APTOS 2019.
- The dataset differs fundamentally: STARE (157 images, 5 disease types) vs. APTOS 2019 (3662 images, 5 DR severity grades). Performance metrics are not directly comparable.
- The CNN architecture differs: the source uses RESNET50 (224×224×3 input) while the dissertation uses both baseline CNN and EfficientNetB0/ResNet50 (256×256 and 512×512 inputs).
- The classification task differs: multi-disease classification (BDR, CRVO, CNV, PDR, Normal) vs. DR severity grading (DR 0–4).
- The sensitivity formula (Eq. 3) as printed in the source contains an apparent error (TP/(TP+TN) instead of TP/(TP+FN)). The dissertation should use the standard formulation and note this discrepancy if citing the source's evaluation framework.

**Risk of self-plagiarism:** N/A — the source is not authored or co-authored by the dissertation candidate (Yesmukhamedov Nurmaganbet).

## VI. TERMINOLOGY INDEX

| Term | Definition/Usage in Source | Consistency Note |
|------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Upgraded CLAHE / Modified CLAHE | CLAHE with controllable global threshold, CLIP LIMIT = T/80 (Eq. 2, p. 5), replacing the conventional fixed clipping value | Dissertation uses "modified CLAHE" — ensure consistent terminology; the source uses "upgraded CLAHE" throughout |

| Fully connected layer / Dense layer | Final classification layer; compacts features to one-dimensional matrix; softmax activation for probability distribution (Section 2.3, pp. 6–7) | Consistent usage |
| Softmax activation | Converts fully-connected layer output "into probability distributions" for classification decisions (Section 2.3, p. 7) | Consistent with dissertation usage |
| Background Diabetic Retinopathy (BDR) | One of five disease classes in STARE classification; retinal condition with background-level diabetic changes | Different classification system from dissertation's DR 0–4 grading |
